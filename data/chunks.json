Decoding Relationship Behavior \u2022 Only two weeks into dating this guy and already I\u2019m making myself miserable worrying that he doesn\u2019t find me attractive enough and obsessing about whether or not he\u2019s going to call! I know that once again I\u2019ll manage to turn all my fears about not being good enough into a self-fulfilling prophecy and ruin yet another chance at a relationship! \u2022 What\u2019s wrong with me? I\u2019m a smart, good-looking guy with a successful career. I have a lot to offer. I\u2019ve dated some terrific women, but inevitably, after a few weeks I lose interest and start to feel trapped. It shouldn\u2019t be this hard to find someone I\u2019m compatible with. \u2022 I\u2019ve been married to my husband for years and yet feel completely alone. He was never one to discuss his emotions or talk about the relationship, but things have gone from bad to"

And yet no one explanation or solution fits the bill. Each case seems unique and personal; each stems from an endless number of possible root causes. Deciphering them would require a deep acquaintance with all the people involved. Past history, previous relationships, and personality type are just a few of the avenues that a therapist would need to pursue. This, at least, is what we, as clinicians in the field of mental health, were taught and believed, until we made a new discovery\u2014one that provided a straightforwardexplanation for all three problems described above and many more. The story of this discovery, and what came after it, is what this book is about. IS LOVE ENOUGH?

If I\u2019d only listened carefully, I could have easily heard another message that was incongruent with this promise, a message that made it clear that Greg feared getting too close and was uncomfortable with commitment. Several times he\u2019d mentioned that he\u2019d never had a stable relationship\u2014that for some reason he always grew tired of his girlfriends and felt the need to move on.

Sometimes he\u2019d claim that his entire work week looked \u201ccrazy\u201d and would ask if we could just meet on the weekend. I\u2019d agree, but inside I had a sinking feeling something was wrong, but what? From then on I was always anxious. I was preoccupied with his whereabouts and became hypersensitive to anything that could possibly imply that he wanted to break up.

As friends, we were happy at first to see Tamara meet someone new that she was excited about, but as the relationship unfolded, we became increasingly concerned over her growing preoccupation with Greg. Her vitality gave way to anxiousness and insecurity. Most of the time she was either waiting for a call from Greg or too worried and preoccupied about the relationship to enjoy spending time with us as she had done in the past. It became apparent that her work was also suffering, and she expressed some concern that she may lose her job. We had always considered Tamara to be an extremely well-rounded, resilient person, and we were starting to wonder if we were mistaken about her strength.

Why was such a successful woman acting in such a helpless way? Why would somebody whom we\u2019ve known to be so adaptive to most of life\u2019s challenges become powerless in this one? The other end of the equation was equally puzzling. Why would Greg send out such mixed messages, although it was clear, even to us, that he did love her? There were many possible complex psychological answers to these questions, but a surprisingly simple yet far-reaching insight into the situation came from an unexpected source. FROM THE THERAPEUTIC NURSERY TO A PRACTICAL SCIENCE OF ADULT LOVE At about the same time that Tamara was dating Greg, Amir was working part-time in the Therapeutic Nursery at Columbia University. Here, he used attachment-guided therapy to help mothers create a more secure bond with their children. The powerful effect that attachment-guided treatment had on the relationship between mother and child encouraged Amir to deepen his knowledge of attachment theory."

As he read more about adult attachment, Amir began to notice attachment behavior in adults all around him. He realized that this discovery could have astounding implications for everyday life. The first thing Amir did, once he realized the far-reaching implications of attachment theory for adult relationships, was to call his longtime friend Rachel. He described to her how effectively attachment theory explained the range of behaviors in adult relationships, and asked her to help him transform the academic studies and scientific data he\u2019d been reading into practical guidelines and advice that people could use to actually change the course of their lives. And that\u2019s how this book came to be.THE SECURE, THE ANXIOUS, AND THE AVOIDANT Attachment theory designates three main \u201cattachment styles,\u201d or manners in which people perceive and respond to intimacy in romantic relationships, which parallel those found in children: Secure, Anxious, and Avoidant.

In addition, people with each of these attachment styles differ in: \u2022 their view of intimacy and togetherness \u2022 the way they deal with conflict \u2022 their attitude toward sex \u2022 their ability to communicate their wishes and needs \u2022 their expectations from their partner and the relationship All people in our society, whether they have just started dating someone or have been married for forty years, fall into one of these categories, or, more rarely, into a combination of the latter two (anxious and avoidant). Just over 50 percent are secure, around 20 percent are anxious, 25 percent are avoidant, and the remaining 3 to 5 percent fall into a fourth, less common disorganized category. Over the past two decades, adult attachment research has produced hundreds of scientific papers and dozens of books that carefully delineate the way in which adults behave in close romantic ties.

Understanding attachment styles is an easy and reliable way to understand and predict people\u2019s behavior in any romantic situation. Infact, one of the main messages of this theory is that in romantic situations, we are programmed to act in a predetermined manner. Where Do Attachment Styles Come From? Initially it was assumed that adult attachment styles were primarily a product of your upbringing. Thus, it was hypothesized that your current attachment style is determined by the way in which you were cared for as a baby: If your parents were sensitive, available, and responsive, you should have a secure attachment style; if they were inconsistently responsive, you should develop an anxious attachment style; and if they were distant, rigid, and unresponsive, you should develop an avoidant attachment style. Today, however, we know that attachment styles in adulthood are influenced by a variety of factors, one of which is the way our parents cared for us, but other factors also come into play, including our genes and life experiences.

Attachment research contained a prototype of Greg\u2014who had an avoidant attachment style\u2014accurate down to the last detail. It summarized how he thought, behaved, and reacted to the world. It predicted his distancing, his finding fault in Tamara, his initiating fights that set back any progress in their relationship, and his enormous difficulty in saying \u201cI love you.\u201d Intriguingly, the research findings explained that though he wanted to be close to her, he felt compelled to push her away\u2014not because he wasn\u2019t \u201cinto her\u201d or because he thought \u201cshe\u2019s not good enough\u201d (as Tamara had concluded). On thecontrary, he pushed her away because he felt the closeness and intimacy increasing. As it also turned out, Tamara wasn\u2019t unique either. The theory explained her behaviors, thoughts, and reactions, typical for someone with an anxious attachment style, with surprising precision as well. It foresaw her increasing clinginess in the face of his distancing; it predicted her inability to concentrate at work, her constant thoughts about the relationship, and her oversensitivity to everything Greg did. It also predicted that even though she decided to break up with"

It showed why, against her better judgment and the advice of close friends, she would do almost anything to try to be close to him. Most important, this theory revealed why Tamara and Greg found it so hard to get along even though they did indeed love each other. They spoke two different languages and exacerbated each other\u2019s natural tendencies\u2014hers to seek physical and emotional closeness and his to prefer independence and shy away from intimacy. The accuracy with which the theory described the pair was uncanny. It was as though the researchers had been privy to the couple\u2019s most intimate moments and personal thoughts. Psychological approaches can be somewhat vague, leaving plenty of room for interpretation, but this theory managed to provide precise, evidence-based insight into a seemingly one-of-a-kind relationship. Although it\u2019s not impossible for someone to change his or her attachment style\u2014on average, one in four people do so over a four- year period\u2014most people are unaware of the issue, so these changes happen without their ever knowing they have occurred (or why).

We were able to view our own romantic behaviors and those of people around us in a fresh new light. By assigning attachment styles to patients, colleagues, and friends, we could interpret their relationshipsdifferently and gain much more clarity. Their behavior no longer seemed baffling and complex, but rather predictable under the circumstances. EVOLUTIONARY TIES Attachment theory is based on the assertion that the need to be in a close relationship is embedded in our genes. It was John Bowlby\u2019s stroke of genius that brought him to the realization that we\u2019ve been programmed by evolution to single out a few specific individuals in our lives and make them precious to us. We\u2019ve been bred to be dependent on a significant other. The need starts in the womb and ends when we die.

More often than not, those who were with somebody who deeply cared about them survived to pass on to their offspring the preference to form intimate bonds. In fact, the need to be near someone special is so important that the brain has a biological mechanism specifically responsible for creating and regulating our connection with our attachment figures (parents, children, and romantic partners). This mechanism, called the attachment system, consists of emotions and behaviors that ensure that we remain safe and protected by staying close to our loved ones. The mechanism explains why a child parted from his or her mother becomes frantic, searches wildly, or cries uncontrollably until he or she reestablishes contact with her. These reactions are coined protest behavior, and we all still exhibit them as grown-ups. In prehistoric times, being close to a partner was a matter of life and death, and our attachment system developed to treat such proximity as an absolute necessity.

Humans are a very heterogeneous species, varying greatly in appearance, attitudes, and behaviors. This accounts to a great extent for our abundance and for our ability to fit into almost any ecological niche on earth. If we were all identical, then any single environmental challenge would have the potential to wipe us all out. Our variability improves the chances that a segment of the population that is unique in some way might survive when others wouldn\u2019t. Attachment style is no different from any other human characteristic. Although we all have a basic need to form close bonds, the way we create them varies. In a very dangerous environment, it would be less advantageous to invest time and energy in just one person because he or she would not likely be around for too long; it would make more sense to get less attached and move on (and hence, the avoidant attachment style)."

True, in modern society, we are not hunted by predators as our ancestors were, but in evolutionary terms we\u2019re only a fraction of a second away from the old scheme of things. Our emotional brain was handed down to us by Homo sapiens who lived in a completely different era, and it is their lifestyle and the dangers they encountered that our emotions were designed to address. Our feelings and behaviors in relationships today are not very different from those of our early ancestors. PROTEST BEHAVIOR IN THE DIGITAL AGE Armed with our new insights about the implications of attachmentstyles in everyday life, we started to perceive people\u2019s actions very differently.

It did not necessarily come from weakness. It originated, instead, from a basic instinct to maintain contact with an attachment figure at all costs and was amplified greatly by an anxious attachment style. For Tamara, the need to remain with Greg was triggered by the very slightest feeling of danger\u2014danger that her lover was out of reach, unresponsive, or in trouble. Letting go in these situations would be insane in evolutionary terms. Using protest behavior, such as calling several times or trying to make him feel jealous, made perfect sense when seen in this light. What we really liked about attachment theory was that it was formulated on the basis of the population at large. Unlike many other psychological frameworks that were created based on couples who come to therapy, this one drew its lessons from everyone\u2014 those who have happy relationships and those who don\u2019t, those who never get treatment and those who actively seek it. It allowed us to learn not only what goes \u201cwrong\u201d in relationships"

You\u2019ll learn what your needs are and who you should be with in order to be happy in a relationship. If you are already in a relationship with a partner who has an attachment style that conflicts with your own, you\u2019ll gain insight into why you both think and act as you do and learn strategies to improve your satisfaction level. In either case, you\u2019ll start to experience change\u2014change for the better, of course.2. Dependency Is Not a Bad Word A few years ago, on a TV reality show that features couples who race against each other around the world and perform challenging tasks, Karen and Tim were the show\u2019s dream couple: beautiful, sexy, smart, and successful.

At certain high-pressure moments during the race and often after an argument, Karen needed Tim to hold her hand. Tim was hesitant to do so; it felt too close, and besides, he didn\u2019t want to succumb to her every whim. By the last show Tim and Karen were leading the race. They almost won the big cash prize, but at the finish line they were beaten. When they were interviewed for the season finale, they were asked if in retrospect they\u2019d do anything differently. Karen said: \u201cI think we lost because I was too needy. Looking back I see that my behavior was a bit much. Many times I needed Tim to hold my hand during the race. I don\u2019t know why it was so important to me. But I\u2019ve learned a lesson from that and I\u2019ve decided that I don\u2019t need to be that way anymore. Why did I need to hold his hand so much?

Finally, he mustered the courage to take the challenge after all. Because of that particular hesitation they lost their lead. Attachment theory teaches us that Karen\u2019s basic assumption, that she can and should control her emotional needs and soothe herself in the face of stress, is simply wrong. She assumed that the problem was that she is too needy. But research findings support the exact opposite.

Our partner regulates our blood pressure, our heart rate, our breathing, and the levels of hormones in our blood. We are no longer separate entities. The emphasis on differentiation that is held by most of today\u2019s popular psychology approaches to adult relationships does not hold water from a biological perspective. Dependency is a fact; it is not a choice or a preference. A study conducted by James Coan is particularly illuminating to that effect: Dr. James Coan is the director of the Affective NeuroscienceLaboratory at the University of Virginia. He investigates the mechanisms through which close social relationships and broader social networks regulate our emotional responses. In this particular study, which he conducted in collaboration with Richard Davidson and Hillary Schaefer, he used functional MRI technology to scan the brains of married women.

The study demonstrates that when two people form an intimate relationship, they regulate each other\u2019s psychological and emotional well-being.

THE \u201cDEPENDENCY PARADOX\u201d Well before brain imaging technology was developed, John Bowlby understood that our need for someone to share our lives with is part of our genetic makeup and has nothing to do with how much we loveourselves or how fulfilled we feel on our own. He discovered that once we choose someone special, powerful and often uncontrollable forces come into play. New patterns of behavior kick in regardless of how independent we are and despite our conscious wills. Once we choose a partner, there is no question about whether dependency exists or not. It always does. An elegant coexistence that does not include uncomfortable feelings of vulnerability and fear of loss sounds good but is not our biology. What proved through evolution to have a strong survival advantage is a human couple becoming one physiological unit, which means that if she\u2019s reacting, then I\u2019m reacting, or if he\u2019s upset, that also makes me unsettled.

The experiment Sarah and Kimmy participated in is probably the most important study in the field of attachment theory\u2014referred to as the strange situation test (the version described here is an abbreviated version of the test). Mary Ainsworth was fascinated by the way in which children\u2019s exploratory drive\u2014their ability to play and learn \u2014could be aroused or stifled by their mother\u2019s presence or departure. She found that having an attachment figure in the room was enough to allow a child to go out into a previously unknown environment and explore with confidence.

When participants felt that their goals were supported by their partner, they reported an increase in self-esteem and an elevated mood after the discussion. They also rated higher the likelihood of achieving their goals after the discussion than before it. Participants who felt that their partner was more intrusive and/or less supportive, on the other hand, were less open to discussing their goals, did not confidently examine ways for achievingthose goals, and tended to downgrade their goals during the course of the discussion.

Interestingly enough, they come from watching babies\u2019 behavior. Attachment styles were first defined by researchers observing the way babies (usually 9 to 18 months old) behaved during the strange situation test (a reunion with a parent after a stressful separation, described on page 29). Here\u2019s a short description of how attachment styles are defined in children. Some of their responses can also be detected in adults who share the same attachment style. Anxious: This baby becomes extremely distressed when mommy leaves the room. When her mother returns, she reacts ambivalently\u2014she is happy to see her but angry at the same time. She takes longer to calm down, and even when she does, it is only temporary. A few seconds later, she\u2019ll angrily push mommy away, wriggle down, and burst into tears again. Secure: The secure baby is visibly distressed when mommy leaves the room. When mother returns, he is very happy and eager to greet her. Once in the safety of her presence, he is quick to be reassured, calm down, and resume play activity. Avoidant:"

When trying to answer this question, let go of preconceptions. There is no one type of personality that is avoidant, nor one that is either secure or anxious. He might be cocky and self-assured and still really crave closeness. On the flip side, she might be nerdy and clumsy and still be averse to intimacy. Ask yourself, what does this particular behavior indicate about his or her attitude toward intimacy and closeness? Are they doing or not doing something because they want to minimize intimacy? Suppose you are dating someone with children from a previous marriage. She might not want to introduce you to them because she is thinking of their well-being and believes it is too early for them to deal with a new man in her life, which is perfectly legitimate.

Is he worried about your future together or about whether you love him enough to stay faithful? Is he very sensitive to details in the relationship that suggest distancing, such as when you make decisions that don\u2019t take him into account?

He says that even after he falls in love he will not compromise, that he values his independence, that he\u2019s mistrustful. Notice how he even talks about \u201cher kids\u201d?

She encounters a problem, wants to solve it, and feels confident enough to do so.

If you have an anxious attachment style, you possess a unique ability to sense when your relationship is threatened.

Using fMRI technology, they asked twenty women to think about\u2014 and then stop thinking about\u2014various relationship scenarios.Intriguingly, they found that when women with an anxious attachment style thought about negative scenarios (conflict, breakup, death of partner), emotion-related areas of the brain became \u201clit up\u201d to a greater degree than in women with other attachment styles.

The avoidants\u2019 defensive self-perception that they are strong and independent is confirmed, as is the belief that others want to pull them into more closeness than they are comfortable with.

In hindsight, we do understand: If you are anxious, the reverse of what happens when you meet someone avoidant happens when you meet someone secure. The messages that come across from someone secure are very honest, straightforward, and consistent. Secures are not afraid of intimacy and know they are worthy of love. They don\u2019t have to beat around the bush or play hard to get. Ambiguous messages are out of the mix, as are tension and suspense. As a result, your attachment system remains relatively calm. Because you are used to equating an activated attachment system with love, you conclude that this can\u2019t be \u201cthe one\u201d because no bells are going off.

When you\u2019re excited about someone but then suddenly have a gut feeling that s/he is not rightfor you, stop and think. Is this actually a deactivating strategy? Are all those small imperfections you\u2019re starting to notice really your attachment system\u2019s way of making you step back? Remind yourself that this picture is skewed and that you need intimacy despite your discomfort with it.

Make a relationship gratitude list. Remind yourself on a daily basis that you tend to think negatively of your partner or date.

Studies demonstrate that individuals with a secure attachment style report higher levels of satisfaction in their relationships than people with other attachmentstyles. Patrick Keelan, as part of his doctoral dissertation at the University of Toronto, conducted a study to test this issue. Together with the late psychology professor Kenneth Dion and his longtime research partner and wife, Karen Dion, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, they followed over one hundred university students who were in dating relationships over a four-month period. They found that secure individuals maintained high levels of relationship satisfaction,"

WHERE DOES THIS \u201cTALENT\u201d COME FROM? If you are secure, are you born with this exceptional capacity or is it something you learn along the way? John Bowlby believed that attachment styles are a function of life experience\u2014especially of our interaction with our parents during infancy. A person will develop a secure attachment style if her parents are sensitive and responsive to her needs. Such a child will learn that she can rely on her parents, confident that they\u2019ll be available to her whenever she needs them. But Bowlby maintained that it didn\u2019t end there; he believed a secure childwould carry this confidence into adulthood and future relationships with romantic partners. Does the evidence support these predictions? In 2000, Leslie Atkinson, who conducts child development research at Ryerson University in Toronto, in collaboration with several other colleagues, conducted a meta-analysis that was based on forty-one prior studies."

To complicate matters further, an idea that has been gaining scientific momentum in recent years is that we are genetically predisposed toward a certain attachment style. It was found, for example, that adult identical twins, who share 100 percent of genes, are much more likely to have the same attachment style than nonidentical twins, who share only 50 percent of genes.

Would the men and women classified as secure in early childhood remain secure as adults? The answer remains unclear: Three studies failed to find a correlation between attachment security in infancy and in adulthood, while two other studies did find a statistically significant connection between the two. What is clear is that even if there is a correlation between attachment style in childhoodand in adulthood, it is weak at best. So where does the secure attachment come from? As more studies become available, there is increasing evidence that a secure attachment style doesn\u2019t originate from a single source. The equation of a caring and sensitive parent producing a secure-for-life child is too one-dimensional; instead it seems that an entire mosaic of factors comes together to create this attachment pattern: our early connection with our parents, our genes, and also something else\u2014our romantic experiences as adults.

As long as they have reason to believe their partner is in some sort of trouble, they\u2019ll continue to back him or her. Mario Mikulincer and Phillip Shaver, in their book Attachment in Adulthood, show that people with a secure attachment style are more likely than others to forgive their partner for wrongdoing. They explain this as a complex combination of cognitive and emotional abilities: \u201cForgiveness requires difficult regulatory maneuvers . . . understanding a transgressor\u2019s needs and motives, and making generous attributions and appraisals concerning the transgressor\u2019s traits and hurtful actions. . . .

This is the sensible thing to do\u2014her sister has a washing machine, it\u2019s free and less trouble. She then idles away the entire day there. Janet has an avoidant attachment style and is always finding opportunities to do things without Mark. For Mark, who has an anxious attachment style, the desire for a washing machine is really a wish for something else altogether\u2014to be close to Janet.When viewed in this light, we can see that the washing machine dispute is only a symptom of the real issue\u2014the fact that Mark and Janet have very different needs when it comes to closeness and spending time together.

The emotional counterbalancing act. If you\u2019re avoidant, you often inflate your self-esteem and sense of independence in comparison to someone else.

Stable instability. The relationship may last for a long time, but an element of uncertainty persists.

If two people are in love, can\u2019t they find a way to be together and work out their differences? We wish the answer was a simple yes, but we\u2019ve often seen that it\u2019s impossible to find a resolution acceptable to both the anxious partner and the avoidant partner, regardless of how much love they feel for each other. Typically, if the relationship runs its usual course (we will show you later that this does not have to be so) despite differing intimacy needs, the anxious partner is usually the one who has to make concessions and accept the rules imposed by the avoidant partner. So even if the relationship is left to its own devices and lasts for a long time (in a stably unstable manner), without an attempt to steer it toward a secure place, things don\u2019t usually get better\u2014and may get worse.

When they feel hurt, they talk, think, and act in an extreme manner, even to the point of threatening to leave (protest behavior). However, once they calm down, they become flooded with positive memories and are then overcome with regret. They reach out to their partner in an attempt to reconcile. But they are often met with a hostile response, because avoidants react differently to a fight. They turn off all attachment-related memories and remember the worst of their partner. What often happens at this point, if you are anxious, is that you not only fail to resolve the original conflict but now find yourself in a worse position than you were in the first place.

Intimacy clashes are very destructive for the non- avoidant partner, who is constantly being pushed away by the avoidant partner. We can see this happening in the examples we cite throughout the book, in behaviors such as maintaining a high degree of secrecy and then blaming the other person of being jealous and needy, in preferring separate beds, and in finding ways to spend less time together. If you are with an avoidant partner, you are constantly being rejected and rebuffed. After experiencing these distancing strategies for a while, you start to blame yourself.

When rat pups are separated from their mothers, a number of physiological reactions occur: their activity level goes down, their heart rate goes down, and so does their growth hormone level. In Hofer\u2019s studies, he gradually replaced each maternal attribute with an artificial substitute: He first warmed the pups with a heating pad, then fed them so their stomachs would be full, and later patted them with a brush, imitating their mother\u2019s licking action. He found that each intervention helped with one aspect of their separation distress. Feeding the pups helped maintain their heart rate at a normal level, warming them helped keep their activity intact, and brushing them helped raise their growth hormone secretion.

Even if you sometimes miss or idealize your ex, reality will slowly sink in. 8. Deactivate: Write down all the reasons you wanted to leave. Your objective is to deactivate your attachment system. The best way to do so is to recall the bad moments in the relationship, and the best way to keep them fresh is to write them down.

But then why was he still asking her out? Maybe he just wanted the companionship? She didn\u2019t want to stop seeing him without a bona fide reason, because she really liked him.

Effective communication works on the understanding that we all have very specific needs in relationships, many of which are determined by your attachment style. They aren\u2019t good or bad, they simply are what they are. If you\u2019re anxious, you have a strong need for closeness and have to be reassured at all times that your partner loves and respects you. If you\u2019re avoidant, you need to be able to maintain some distance, either emotional or physical, from your partner and preserve a large degree of separateness.

A major misconception about conflict in romantic relationships is that people in good relationships should fight very little. There\u2019s an expectation that, if well matched, you and your partner will see eye to eye on most matters and argue rarely, if at all. Sometimes arguments are even considered to be \u201cproof \u201d that two people are incompatible or that a relationship is derailing. Attachment theory shows us that these assumptions are unsubstantiated; all couples\u2014even secure ones\u2014 have their fair share of fights. What does differentiate between couples and affect their satisfaction levels in their relationships is not how much they disagree, but how they disagree and what they disagree about. Attachment researchers have learned that conflicts can serve as an opportunity for couples to get closer and deepen their bond. There are two main kinds of conflict\u2014the bread-and-butter type and the intimacy-centered type. In chapter 8, we witnessed what happens when people with diametrically opposed intimacy needs get together and, despite their best intentions, struggle to find common ground. We saw how these conflicting needs can spill over into every area"

Sometimes, understanding the basic biology of attachment helps you prevent conflict before it even happens. Oxytocin, a hormone and neuropeptide that has gotten a lot of press coverage in recent years, plays a major role in attachment processes and serves several purposes: It causes women to go into labor, strengthens attachment, and serves as a social cohesion hormone by increasing trust and cooperation.

For the anxious, conflict can trigger very basic concerns about their partner\u2019s responsiveness to their needs and about rejection or abandonment. When a dispute arises, they experience many negative thoughts and react by using protest behavior, aimed at getting their partner\u2019s attention.

Their response, though often dramatic, is usually ineffective. People with an avoidant attachment style are also threatened by the possibility that their mate won\u2019t really be there for them when needed. However, to deal with these beliefs, they adopt the opposite approach \u2014they suppress their need for intimacy by shutting down emotionally and adopting a defensive air of independence. The more personal the conflict becomes, the stronger their urge grows to distance themselves from the situation. To do this they use deactivating strategies\u2014such as finding fault with their partner\u2014in order to feel less close to him or her. Another study by Gary Creasey, together with two graduate students at the time, Kathy Kershaw and Ada Boston, found that both anxious people and avoidant people use fewer positive conflict-resolution tactics, express more aggression, and tend more toward withdrawal and escalation of conflict than secure people. Perhaps the similarities in their attitude toward conflict\u2014that is, their basic belief in their partner\u2019s unavailability and their difficulty expressing their needs effectively\u2014explain this finding.

We recently saw a popular boy-meets-girl film that did just that. A young man falls passionately in love with a beautiful and intelligent woman. He becomes consumed by the desire to spend the rest of his life with her. She, on the other hand, is determined to stay free and unattached\u2014 and tells him so from the start.

His mother, a popular science editor who valued creativity and self-motivation, allowed him to stay home from school whenever he wanted and study what interested him. Although this freedom sometimes got him into trouble, during high school he wrote his first large-scale work, about birds of prey in the Bible and in ancient Assyria and Babylon. His thesis examined the evolution of symbolism from a culture of multiple deities to one of monotheism. After high school, Levine served as a press liaison"

After his compulsory army service, having developed a passion for working with people as well as a love for science, Levine enrolled in medical school at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where he received numerous awards. During medical school, he organized student meetings with Dr. Eiferman, a psychoanalyst, to discuss how doctors can preserve their sensitivity to the hospitalized patients\u2019 needs while negotiating a complex hospital hierarchy. He was awarded the faculty prize for his graduation thesis, \u201cHuman Sexuality Viewed from the Perspective of Childhood Gender Nonconformity,\u201d which was later adapted for a university seminar.

What was this mysterious and powerful emotion that defeated my parents, complicated my own life, and seemed to be the central source of joy and suffering for so many of us? Was there a way through the maze to enduring love? I followed my fascination with love and connection into counseling and psychology. As part of my training, I studied this drama as described by poets and scientists. I taught disturbed children who had been denied love. I counseled adults who struggled with the loss of love. I worked with families where family members loved each other, but could not come together and could not live apart. Love remained a mystery. Then, in the final phase of getting my doctorate in counseling psychology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, I started to work with couples. I was instantly mesmerized by the intensity of their struggles and the way they often spoke of their relationships in terms of life and death.

They certainly didn\u2019t want to be taught rules for fighting effectively. Love, it seemed, was all about nonnegotiables. You can\u2019t bargain for compassion, for connection. These are not intellectual reactions; they are emotional responses. So I started to simply stay with the couples\u2019 experiences and let them teach me about the emotional rhythms and patterns in the dance of romantic love. I began to tape my couple sessions and replay them over and over again. As I watched couples shout and weep, bicker and shut down, I began to understand that there were key negative and positive emotional moments that defined a relationship. With the help of my thesis advisor, Les Greenberg, I started to develop a new couple therapy, one that was based on these moments. We called it Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy, EFT for short.

First they said that emotion was something that adults should control. Indeed, that too much emotion was the basic problem in most marriages. It should be overcome, not listened to or indulged. But most important, they argued, healthy adults are self-sufficient. Only dysfunctional people need or depend on others. We had names for these people: they were enmeshed, codependent, merged, fused.

The message of EFT is simple: Forget about learning how to argue better, analyzing your early childhood, making grand romantic gestures, or experimenting with new sexual positions. Instead, recognize and admit that you are emotionally attached to and dependent on your partner in much the same way that a child is on a parent for nurturing, soothing, and protection. Adult attachments may be more reciprocal and less centered on physical contact, but the nature of the emotional bond is the same. EFT focuses on creating and strengthening this emotional bond between partners by identifying and transforming the key moments that foster an adult loving relationship: being open, attuned, and responsive to each other. Today EFT is revolutionizing couple therapy. Rigorous studies during the past fifteen years have shown that 70 to 75 percent of couples who go through EFT recover from distress and are happy in their relationships. The results appear lasting,"

Others, more historically inclined, regard it as a sentimental social custom created by the minstrels of thirteenth-century France. Biologists and anthropologists view it as a strategy to ensure the transmission of genes and rearing of offspring. But to most people love has been and remains still a mystical elusive emotion, open to description but defying definition. Back in the 1700s, Benjamin Franklin, an astute student in so many areas, could only attest to love as \u201cchangeable, transient and accidental.\u201d More recently, Marilyn Yalom, in her scholarly book on the history of the wife, admitted defeat and called love an \u201cintoxicating mixture of sex and sentiment that no one can define.\u201d My English barmaid mother\u2019s description of love as a \u201cfunny five minutes\u201d is just as apt, if a little more cynical.

Bowlby insisted the problems were mostly external, rooted in real relationships with real people. Working with disturbed youngsters at the Child Guidance Clinics in London, he began to believe that blighted relationships with parents had left them with only a few, negative ways to deal with basic feelings and needs. Later, in 1938, as a beginning clinician under the supervision of the noted analyst Melanie Klein, Bowlby was assigned a young hyperactive boy who had an extremely anxious mother. He was not allowed to talk to the mother, however, since only the child\u2019s projections and fantasies were deemed of interest. That infuriated Bowlby.

His findings confirmed his belief in the reality of emotional starvation and his conviction that loving contact is as important as physical nutrition. Along with his studies and observations, Bowlby was impressed by Charles Darwin\u2019s ideas of how natural selection favors responses that help survival. Bowlby came to the conclusion that keeping precious others close is a brilliant survival technique wired in by evolution. Bowlby\u2019s theory was radical and noisily rejected.

Today it is widely accepted that children have an absolute requirement for safe, ongoing physical and emotional closeness, and that we ignore this only at great cost. Love and Adults Bowlby died in 1990. He did not live to see the second revolution sparked by his work: the application of attachment theory to adult love. Bowlby himself had maintained that adults have the same need for attachment\u2014he had studied World War II widows and discovered they exhibited behavior patterns similar to those of homeless youngsters\u2014and that this need is the force that shapes adult relationships. But again his ideas were rejected. No one expected a reserved upper-class conservative Englishman to solve the riddle of romantic love! And anyway, we thought we already knew all there was to know about love. Love is simply short-lived, disguised sexual infatuation, Freud\u2019s basic instinct dressed up. Or a kind of immature need to rely on others. Or, love is a moral stance\u2014a selfless sacrifice that is all about giving rather than"

Psychologists use words like undifferentiated, codependent, symbiotic, or even fused to describe people who seem unable to be self-sufficient or definitively assert themselves with others. In contrast, Bowlby talked about \u201ceffective dependency\u201d and how being able, from \u201cthe cradle to the grave,\u201d to turn to others for emotional support is a sign and source of strength. Research documenting adult attachment began just before Bowlby\u2019s death. Social psychologists Phil Shaver and Cindy Hazan, then at the University of Denver, decided to ask men and women questions about their love relationships to see if they exhibited the same responses and patterns as mothers and children. They wrote up a love quiz that was published in the local Rocky Mountain News. In their answers, adults spoke of needing emotional closeness from their lover, wanting assurance"

The women who described themselves as feeling secure in love relationships on the questionnaires were able to share their unhappiness about the upcoming task openly and ask for support from their partners. Women who generally denied their attachment needs and avoided closeness withdrew more at these moments. Men responded to their partners in two ways: when they described themselves as secure with relationships, they became even more supportive than usual, touching and smiling at their partners and offering comfort; if they described themselves as uncomfortable with attachment needs, they became markedly less sympathetic when their partners expressed their needs, downplaying their partners\u2019 distress, showing less warmth, and touching less.

Clients sometimes tell me, \u201cThings were going so well. We had a great four days. It felt like we were friends. But then that one incident happened and everything went to hell between us. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Dramatic exchanges between lovers evolve so fast and are so chaotic and heated that we don\u2019t catch"

Attachment theory answered the three questions that had tormented me. Very simply, it told me that: 1. The powerful emotions that came up in my couples\u2019sessions were anything but irrational. They made perfect sense. Partners acted like they were fighting for their lives in therapy because they were doing just that. Isolation and the potential loss of loving connection is coded by the human brain into a primal panic response. This need for safe emotional connection to a few loved ones is wired in by millions of years of evolution. Distressed partners may use different words but they are always asking the same basic questions, \u201cAre you there for me?"

This longing for emotional connection with those nearest to us is the emotional priority, overshadowing even the drive for food or sex. The drama of love is all about this hunger for safe emotional connection, a survival imperative we experience from the cradle to the grave. Loving connection is the only safety nature ever offers us. 2. These emotions and attachment needs were the plot behind negative interactions like the Demon Dialogues. Now I understood why this kind of pattern was so compelling and never ending. When safe connection seems lost, partners go into fight-or-flight mode. They blame and get aggressive to get a response, any response, or they close down and try not to care. Both are terrified; they are just dealing with it differently.

Immobility in the face of danger is a wired-in way to deal with a sense of helplessness. 3. The key moments of change in EFT were moments of secure bonding.

I never saw that before.\u201d Tim is able to see how his distancing sets Sarah up to become more demanding. They begin to see the pattern and to stop blaming the other for the steps. Now they are ready for a second conversation. In Finding the Raw Spots, Tim and Sarah begin to understand their own and their partner\u2019s reactions and that the drama here is all about the safety of their emotional attachment. Each partner starts to look beyond immediate reactions, such as Sarah\u2019s rage and Tim\u2019s cool distancing. We begin to plug into the deeper current of softer feelings, feelings connected with attachment needs and fears. Tim turns to a calmer and very attentive Sarah and says, \u201cYou\u2019re right.

All it takes is a slight turning away of the head or a flip, careless remark. There is no closeness without this sensitivity. If our connection with our mate is safe and strong, we can deal with these moments of sensitivity. Indeed, we can use them to bring our partner even closer. But when we don\u2019t feel safe and connected, these moments are like a spark in a tinder forest. They set fire to the whole relationship. This is what has happened in the first three minutes of an explosive session with Jim and Pam, a long-married couple who were experiencing a serious downswing in their relationship, though they still noted each other\u2019s appealing qualities.

This usually happens after the Protest Polka has been going on for a while in a relationship, when dancers feel so hopeless that they begin to give up and put their own emotions and needs in the deep freeze, leaving only numbness and distance. Both people step back to escape hurt and despair. In dance terms, suddenly no one is on the floor; both partners are sitting out. This is the most dangerous dance of all. All of us get caught in any one or all of these negative interactions at some point in our love relationships. For some these are brief, though risky, dances in otherwise secure connections.

The starting cue for this pattern of responses is that we are hurt by or feel vulnerable with our partner and become suddenly out of control. Emotional safety is lost. When we are alarmed, we use anything that promises to give us back this control. We can do this by defining our partner in a negative way, by shining a black light on him or her.

One partner reaches out, albeit in a negative way, and the other steps back, and the pattern repeats. The dance also goes on forever because the emotions and needs behind the dance are the most powerful on this planet. Attachment relationships are the only ties on Earth where any response is better than none. When we get no emotional response from a loved one, we are wired to protest. The Protest Polka is all about trying to get a response, a response that connects and reassures. Couples have a difficult time recognizing this pattern, however. Unlike the obvious attack-attack pattern of Find the Bad Guy, the Protest Polka is more subtle. One partner is demanding, actively protesting the disconnection; the other is withdrawing, quietly protesting the implied criticism.

Most destructive is the belief that a healthy, mature adult is not supposed to need emotional connection and so is not entitled to this kind of caring. Clients tell me, \u201cI cannot just tell him that I am feeling small and need his arms around me. I\u2019m not a kid,\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t just ask to come first, even sometimes.

Strong emotion mobilizes the body. It puts it in survival mode with lightning speed. Each emotion has a specific physiological signature. When we are afraid, blood flow increases to the legs; when we are angry, blood flow increases to the hands. 3. Our intellect, sitting behind our forehead in the brain\u2019s prefrontal cortex, is a little slow. Now it catches up with our emotional brain, our amygdala, and goes looking for what all this means.

They are aware of two crucial elements of de-escalation: first, that how a partner responds at a key moment of conflict and disconnection can be deeply painful and threatening to the other; and second, that a partner\u2019s negative reactions can be desperate attempts to deal with attachment fears. Couples won\u2019t always be able to apply this knowledge and the specific steps of de-escalation every time they disconnect. It takes practice, going over an unsettling past encounter again and again until it makes coherent sense and, unlike the original event, can draw a possible supportive response from the other partner. Once couples have mastered this, they can begin to integrate these steps into the everyday rhythm of their relationship. When they argue or feel distanced from each other, they can take a step back and ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening here?\u201d Even with practice, couples won\u2019t always be able to do this; the heat may be too high at certain times.

If we don\u2019t learn to let our partner really see our attachment needs in an open, authentic way, the chances of getting these needs met are minuscule. We have to send the signal loud and clear for our partner to get the message. If we have generally found others to be safe havens and have a secure bond with our lover, then it is easier for us to keep our emotional balance when we feel vulnerable, connect with our deepest feelings, and voice the attachment longing that is always part of us. If we are feeling unsure of our relationship, it is harder to trust our longings and risk being vulnerable. In that situation, some of us try to stay in control of our emotions at all costs, to hide them, and instead demand what we need. Others deny that the emotions and needs even exist. But they are there. As the perceptive but murderous villain of the movie In the Cut murmurs to Meg Ryan, the heroine who avoids closeness with others, \u201cYou want it so much, it hurts.\u201d"

Dubbed the \u201ccuddle hormone,\u201d oxytocin, which is produced only by mammals, is associated with states of contented bliss. It seems to create a cascade of pleasure, comfort, and calm. Researchers discovered the power of oxytocin when they compared the mating habits of two different kinds of prairie voles. In one species, males and females are monogamous, rear their young together, and form lifelong bonds; in the other, males and females take the one-night-stand approach and leave offspring to fend for themselves. The faithful rodents, it turns out, produce oxytocin; their promiscuous cousins do not. However, when scientists gave monogamous voles a chemical that counteracts oxytocin, these little animals had sex but didn\u2019t bond with their partners. And when researchers gave the same rodents extra oxytocin, they bonded tightly, whether they mated or not. In humans, oxytocin is released when we are in proximity to or physical contact with an attachment figure, especially during moments of heightened emotion, such as orgasm and breast-feeding.

The mates who inflict these injuries are not being malicious or purposely insensitive. Indeed, they usually have the best of intentions. Most simply do not know how to tune in to their loved ones\u2019 attachment needs and offer the comfort of their emotional presence. Some, too, are absorbed by attempts to contain their own anxiety."

The helplessness and fear they engender are almost indelible; they set off our survival instincts. It\u2019s wiser, in survival terms, to be wary and discover there is no real danger than to be trusting and find out the danger is real.

This was brought home to me when my then eight-year-old son came down with acute appendicitis at a summer lake party my husband, John, and I were hosting. I dashed off to the nearest hospital with instructions to John to shut down the party and follow us. The small local hospital could not operate, and we had to make a long and anxious trip into town.

About five years ago, I began mapping out the steps in the dance of forgiveness and reconciliation. Together with my students and colleagues, I watched tapes of counseling sessions and saw how some couples hit the Never Again moment and got stuck, and others worked through the injury. We learned that couples had to be able to manage Conversations 1 to 3 and create a basic safety in their relationship before they could engage in a Forgiving Injuries conversation. A recent research project has further sharpened our understanding of relationship traumas. We\u2019ve learned that they are not always obvious, that what\u2019s important is not the events themselves, but the vulnerabilities they arouse. For some partners at certain times, a flirtation may prove more wounding than an affair. We\u2019ve also found that couples can suffer multiple traumas, and that the greater the number, the harder it is to renew trust.

The hurt partner needs to speak his or her pain as openly and simply as possible. This is not always easy to do. It means resisting making a case against your partner, and staying focused on describing the pain, the specific situation in which it occurred, and how it affects your sense of safety with your partner. When it is hard to capture the essence of an injury, we try to help people plug into the emotions that arose by asking the following questions: At a moment of urgent need, did I feel deprived of comfort? Did I feel deserted and alone? Did I feel devalued by my partner when I desperately needed validation that I and my feelings were important? Did my partner suddenly appear to be a source of danger to me rather than the haven of safety that"

Rituals engage us, emotionally and physically, so that we become riveted to the present moment in a positive way. Religion has used ritual forever. I remember a famous study led by psychologist Alfred Tomatis of a group of clinically depressed monks. After much examination, researchers concluded that the group\u2019s depression stemmed from their abandoning a twice-daily ritual of gathering to sing Gregorian chants. They had lost the sense of community and the comfort of singing together in harmony. Creating beautiful music together was a formal recognition of their connection and a shared moment of joy.

Dan Siegel, a main proponent of incorporating the new findings in brain science into our understanding of relationships, reports in his book Parenting from the Inside Out that mental models are ingrained in our brains in patterns of neural firing. Neurons send messages to one another, and when messages are repeated over and over again, as Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb tells us, neurons fire together and then wire together. New experiences, if they are reflected on and assimilated, can actually reshape our brains. Thus, Marion and Steve are busy translating new interactions into new pathways in their brains, pathways that reinforce their positive ways of seeing and engaging each other. I think all the ways"

The quality of our central relationships affects how we face and heal from trauma, and as everything moves in a circle, trauma has an impact on our relationships with the people we love. The word trauma comes from a Latin word meaning to wound. The old idea in psychology was that only a few of us faced true trauma in our lives. But we are now starting to realize that traumatic stress is almost as common as depression. As many as 8 to 12 percent of women in the US and in Britain have been reported as having significant post-traumatic stress at some point in their lives.

Over the years, my colleagues and I have seen survivors of childhood abuse, victims of rape or assault, parents who have suffered the loss of a child, and men and women who have faced brutal illness or horrendous accidents. We have also seen police officers distressed by the death of buddies, firefighters devastated by their inability to save all those who are in peril, and soldiers haunted by the echoes of battle. If you have a responsive love partner, you have a secure base in the chaos. If you are emotionally alone, you are in free fall. Having someone you can rely on for connection and support makes healing from trauma easier. Chris Fraley and his colleagues at the University of Illinois found evidence of this in their study of 9/11 survivors who were in or near the World Trade Center.

In fact, the securely attached survivors, reported their friends and relatives, appeared to be even better adjusted after the attack than they were before.

If we cannot successfully connect with others, our struggles to cope with trauma become less effective, and our main resource, our love relationship, often begins to sink under its weight. On the other hand, facing the monster with a loved one beside us gives us the best shot at finding our strength and resilience. And standing together strengthens the bond with our partners. Locking Up Feelings Even if on some instinctual level we know that we need love to heal the wounds of trauma, it is not always easy to open up and seek that caring. Often, to survive in a moment of danger, we have to freeze our feelings and simply act. This is particularly true for those who step into harm\u2019s way in their everyday jobs.

Some of us think that shutting down and keeping the monster isolated, in a box, is the only way to protect our home life.

For most of us, on our deathbeds, it is the quality of our connection with our precious ones that will matter most. Instinctively, we know that those who grasp the imperatives of attachment live better lives. Yet our culture encourages us to compete rather than connect. Even though we are programmed by millions of years of evolution to relentlessly seek out belonging and intimate connection, we persist in defining healthy people as those who do not need others.

A human being longs for, is wired for, connection with others. Our nature is to bond intimately with a precious few, but then, having learned the lessons of belonging, to connect with others, our friends, colleagues, our tribe. When we are at our best, we offer support and caring to others because we recognize that they are just like us, human and vulnerable.

This is one of the most useful books you will ever read.\u00d3 \u00d1WILLIAM URY, co-author of Getting to Yes and author of The Third Side \u00d2Marshall Rosenberg\u00d5s book, Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life , is essential reading for anyone who wants to improve their communication skills. Applying the concepts within the book will help guide the reader towards a more loving, compassionate, and nonviolent way of understanding and functioning with others, and foster more compassion in the world. I highly recommend this book.\u00d3 \u00d1MARIANNE WILLIAMSON, author of Everyday Grace , President Global Renaissance Alliance \u00d2The extraordinary language of Nonviolent Communication is changing how parents relate to children, teachers to students, and how we all relate to each other and even to ourselves. It is precise, disciplined, and enormously compassionate. Most important, once we study NVC we can\u00d5t ignore the potential for transformation that lies in any relationship difficult\u00d1if we only bother to communicate with skill"

What happens to disconnect us from our compassionate nature, leading us to behave violently and exploitatively? And conversely, what allows some people to stay connected to their compassionate nature under even the most trying circumstances? My preoccupation with these questions began in childhood, around the summer of 1943, when our family moved to Detroit, Michigan. The second week after we arrived, a race war erupted over an incident at a public park. More than forty people were killed in the next few days. Our neighborhood was situated in the center of the violence, and we spent three days locked in the house. When the race riot ended and school began, I discovered that a name could be as dangerous as any skin color. When the teacher called my name during attendance, two boys glared at"

After school, the two were waiting for me: they threw me to the ground, kicked and beat me. Since that summer in 1943, I have been examining the two questions I mentioned. What empowers us, for example, to stay connected to our compassionate nature even under the worst circumstances? I am thinking of people like Etty Hillesum, who remained compassionate even while subjected to the grotesque conditions of a German concentration camp. As she wrote in her journal at the time, I am not easily frightened. Not because I am brave but because I know that I am dealing with human beings, and that I must try as hard as I can to understand everything that anyone ever does.

Instead of being habitual, automatic reactions, our words become conscious responses based firmly on an awareness of what we are perceiving, feeling, and wanting. We are led to express ourselves with honesty and clarity, while simultaneously paying others a respectful and empathic attention. In any exchange, we come to hear our own deeper needs and those of others. NVC trains us to observe carefully, and to be able to specify behaviors and conditions that are affecting us. We learn to identify and clearly articulate what we are concretely wanting in a given situation. The form is simple, yet powerfully transformative. As NVC replaces our old patterns of defending, withdrawing, or attacking in the face of judgment and criticism, we come"

If they don\u00d5t appear happy, we feel responsible and compelled to do something about it. This can easily lead us to see the very people who are closest to us as burdens.

In the early days of a relationship, partners typically relate joyfully and compassionately to each other out of a sense of freedom. The relationship is exhilarating, spontaneous, wonderful. Eventually, however, as the relationship becomes \u00d2serious,\u00d3 partners may begin to assume responsibility for each other\u00d5s feelings.

If, however, we\u00d5re uncertain that it has been received as intended, we need to be able to clearly request a response that tells us how the message was heard so as to be able to correct any mis- understanding.

The Chinese philosopher Chuang-Tzu stated that true empathy requires listening with the whole being: \u00d2The hearing that is only in the ears is one thing. The hearing of the understanding is another. But the hearing of the spirit is not limited to any one faculty, to the ear, or to the mind. Hence it demands the emptiness of all the faculties. And when the faculties are empty, then the whole being listens. There is then a direct grasp of what is right there before you that can never be heard with the ear or understood with the mind.\u00d3 In relating to others, empathy occurs only when we have successfully shed all preconceived ideas and judgments about them.

Distinguishing Stimulus From Cause The first step to fully expressing anger in NVC is to divorce the other person from any responsibility for our anger.

The Thinking Behind The Use Of Force The intention behind the protective use of force is to prevent injury or injustice. The intention behind the punitive use of force is to cause individuals to suffer for their perceived misdeeds. When we grab a child who is running into the street to prevent the child from being injured, we are applying protective force.

The corrective process is therefore one of education, not punishment. Ignorance includes (a) a lack of awareness of the consequences of our actions, (b) an inability to see how our needs may be met without injury to others, (c) the belief that we have the \u00d2right\u00d3 to punish or hurt others because they \u00d2deserve\u00d3 it, and (d) delusional thinking that involves, for example, hearing a \u00d2voice\u00d3 that instructs us to kill someone.

Second, the apparent success of corporal punishment in influencing a child doesn\u00d5t mean that other methods of influence wouldn\u00d5t have worked equally well. Finally, I share the concerns of many parents about the social consequences of using physical punishment. When parents opt to use force, we may win the battle of getting children to do what we want, but in the process, are we not perpetuating a social norm that justifies violence as a means of resolving differences? In addition to the physical, other uses of force also qualify as punishment. One is the use of blame to discredit another person: for example, a parent may label a child as \u00d2wrong,\u00d3 \u00d2selfish,\u00d3 or \u00d2immature\u00d3 when a child doesn\u00d5t behave in"

I define judgments\u00d1both positive and negative\u00d1as life-alienating communication. In the corporate trainings we offer, I often encounter managers who defend the practice of praising and complimenting by claiming that \u00d2it works.\u00d3 \u00d2Research shows,\u00d3 they assert, \u00d2that if a manager compliments employees, they work harder.

What is most disturbing for me, however, is that the beauty of appreciation is spoiled when people begin to notice the lurking intent to get something out of them. Furthermore, when we use positive feedback as a means to influence others, it may not be clear how they are receiving the message. There is a cartoon where one Native American remarks to another, \u00d2Watch me use modern psychology on my horse!\u00d3 He then leads his friend near to where the horse can overhear their conversation and exclaims, \u00d2I have the fastest, most courageous horse in all the West!\u00d3 The horse looks sad and says to itself, \u00d2How do you like that?

We were to write down a question, drop it in a box, and then take turns, each person drawing out a question and responding to it out loud.

How grievous it seemed to me to miss the chance of appreciating the people who have been the greatest positive influences in our lives! Immediately an uncle of mine, Julius Fox, came to mind. When I was a boy, he came daily to offer nursing care to my grandmother, who was totally paralyzed. While he cared for my grandmother, he always had a warm and loving smile on his face.

Summary Conventional compliments often take the form of judgments, however positive, and are sometimes offered to manipulate the behavior of others. NVC encourages the expression of appreciation solely for celebration. We state (1) the action that has contributed to our well-being, (2) the particular need of ours that has been fulfilled, and (3) the feeling of pleasure engendered as a result. When we receive appreciation expressed in this way, we can do so without any feeling of superiority or false humility by celebrating along with the person who is offering the appreciation.

Dr. Rosenberg is the 2006 recipient of the Global Village Foundation's Bridge of Peace Award, and the Association of Unity Churches International 2006 Light of God Expressing Award. Rosenberg spends more than 250 days each year traveling the globe, teaching Nonviolent Communication (NVC) in hundreds of local communities, at national conferences, and in some of the most impoverished, war-torn states of the world. Growing up in a turbulent Detroit neighborhood, Dr. Rosenberg developed a keen interest in new forms of communication that would provide peaceful alternatives to the violence he encountered. His interest led to a doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of Wisconsin in 1961, where he studied under Carl Rogers. His subsequent life experience and study of comparative religion motivated him to develop the Nonviolent Communication (NVC) process. Dr. Rosenberg first used the NVC process in federally funded school integration projects to provide mediation and communication skills training during the 1960s. He founded the Center for Nonviolent Communication in 1984, an international nonprofit peacemaking organization, which is now affiliated with more than 180 certified NVC trainers in 35 countries around the globe.

It was really exciting! But after the marriage, it was a battle from the beginning. \u201cIn my first marriage, we had three or four good years before the baby came. After the baby was born, I felt like she gave her attention to the baby and I no longer mattered.

Sometimes the answers are couched in psychological research jargon that is almost incomprehensible. Sometimes they are couched in humor and folklore.

The desire for romantic love in marriage is deeply rooted in our psychological makeup. Almost every popular magazine has at least one article each issue on keeping love alive in a marriage. Books abound on the subject. Television and radio talk shows deal with it. Keeping love alive in our marriages is serious business. With all the books, magazines, and practical help available, why is it that so few couples seem to have found the secret to keeping love alive after the wedding?

Most of us grow up learning the language of our parents and siblings, which becomes our primary or native tongue. Later, we may learn additional languages but usually with much more effort. These become our secondary languages. We speak and understand best our native language. We feel most comfortable speaking that language.

M y conclusion after thirty years of marriage counseling is that there are basically five emotional love languages\u2014five ways that people speak and understand emotional love. In the field of linguistics a language may have numerous dialects or variations. Similarly, within the five basic emotional love languages, there are many dialects. That accounts for the magazine articles titled \u201c10 Ways to Let Your Spouse Know You Love Her,\u201d \u201c20 Ways to Keep Your Man at Home,\u201d or \u201c365 Expressions of Marital Love.\u201d There are not 10, 20, or 365 basic love languages. In my opinion, there are only five. However, there may be numerousdialects. The number of ways to express love within a love language is limited only by one\u2019s imagination. The important thing is to speak the love language of your spouse. We have long known that in early childhood development each child develops unique emotional patterns. Some children, for example, develop a pattern of low self-esteem whereas others have healthy self-esteem. Some develop emotional patterns of insecurity whereas others grow up feeling secure.

The children who feel loved by their parents and peers will develop a primary emotional love language based on their unique psychological makeup and the way their parents and other significant persons expressed love to them. They will speak and understand one primary love language. They may later learn a secondary love language, but they will always feel most comfortable with their primary language. Children who do not feel loved by their parents and peers will also develop a primary love language. However, it will be somewhat distorted in much the same way as some children may learn poor grammar and have an underdeveloped vocabulary. That poor programming does not mean they cannot become good communicators. But it does mean they will have to work at it more diligently than those who had a more positive model. Likewise, children who grow up with an underdeveloped sense ofemotional love can also come to feel loved and to communicate love, but they will have to work at it more diligently than those who grew up in a healthy, loving atmosphere.

For love, we will climb mountains, cross seas, traverse desert sands, and endure untold hardships. Without love, mountains become unclimbable, seas uncrossable, deserts unbearable, and hardships our plight in life. The Christian apostle to the Gentiles, Paul, exalted love when he indicated that all human accomplishments that are not motivated by love are, in the end, empty.

Child psychologists affirm that every child has certain basicemotional needs that must be met if he is to be emotionally stable. Among those emotional needs, none is more basic than the need for love and affection, the need to sense that he or she belongs and is wanted. With an adequate supply of affection, the child will likely develop into a responsible adult. Without that love, he or she will be emotionally and socially retarded.

Your words may give your spouse the courage necessary to take that first step. Please note that I am not talking about pressuring your spouse to do something that you want."

That keeps your mind from wandering and communicates that he/she has your full attention. 2. Don\u2019t listen to your spouse and do something else at the same time. Remember, quality time is giving someone your undivided attention. If you are watching, reading, or doing something else in which you are keenly interested and cannot turn from immediately, tell your spouse the truth. A positive approach might be, \u201cI know you are trying to talk to me and I\u2019m interested, but I want to give you my fullattention.

Clenched fists, trembling hands, tears, furrowed brows, and eye movement may give you clues as to what the other is feeling. Sometimes body language speaks one message while words speak another. Ask for clarification to make sure you know what she is really thinking and feeling. 5 . Refuse to interrupt. Recent research has indicated that the average individual listens for only seventeen seconds before interrupting and interjecting his own ideas. If I give you my undivided attention while you are talking, I will refrain from defending myself or hurling accusations at you or dogmatically stating my position.

Many adults grew up in homes where the expression of thoughts and feelings was not encouraged but condemned. To request a toy was to receive a lecture on the sad state of family finances. The child went away feeling guilty for having the desire, and he quickly learned not to express his desires. When he expressed anger, the parents responded with harsh and condemning words. Thus, the child learnedthat expressing angry feelings is not appropriate. If the child was made to feel guilty for expressing disappointment at not being able to go to the store with his father, he learned to hold his disappointment inside.

Anthropologists are enamored by cultural patterns that tend to pervade cultures, and so was I. Could it be that gift giving is a fundamental expression of love that transcends cultural barriers? Is the attitude of love always accompanied by the concept of giving? Those are academic and somewhat philosophical questions, but if the answer is yes, it has profound practical implications for North American couples.

Mothers remember the days their children bring a flower from the yard as a gift. They feel loved, even if it was a flower they didn\u2019t want picked.

In a culture where people wore sandals and walked on dirt streets, it was customary for the servant of the household to wash the feet of guests as they arrived. Jesus, who had instructed His disciples to love one another, gave them an example of how to express that love when He took a basin and a towel and proceeded to wash their feet.1 After that simple expression of love, He encouraged His disciples to follow His example.

A wife may say to her husband after he gives her a criticism, \u201cIt sounds like that is extremely important to you.

My wife and I were strolling through Reynolda Gardens, enjoying the flora, some of which had been imported from around the world. The gardens had originally been developed by R. J. Reynolds, the tobacco magnate, as a part of his country estate. They are now a part of the Wake Forest University campus. We had just passed the rose garden when I noticed Ann, a woman who had begun counseling two weeks earlier, approaching us. She was looking down at the cobblestone walkway and appeared to be in deep thought. When I greeted her, she was startled but looked up and smiled. I introduced her to Karolyn, and we exchanged pleasantries. Then, without any lead-in, she asked me one of the most profound questions I have ever heard: \u201cDr. Chapman, is it possible to love"

We reflected on the early days of our own marriage and remembered that we had often experienced feelings of hate. Our condemning words to each other had stimulated hurt and, on the heels of hurt, anger. Anger held inside becomes hate. What made the difference for us? We both knew it was the choice to love. We had realized that if we continued our pattern of demanding and condemning, we would destroy our marriage. Fortunately over a period of about a year, we had learned how to discuss our differences without condemning each other, how to make decisions without destroying our unity, how to give constructive suggestions without being demanding, and eventually how to speak each other\u2019s primary love"

In what many have called Jesus\u2019 greatest sermon, I read the following words, which I call love\u2019s greatest challenge.

The chance of getting divorced remains so high that it makes sense for all married couples-- including those who are currently satisfied with their relationship--to put extra effort into their marriages to keep them strong. One of the saddest reasons a marriage dies is that neither spouse recognizes its value until it is too late. Only after the papers have been signed, the furniture divided, and separate apartments rented do the exes realize how much they really gave up when they gave up on each other. Too often a good marriage is taken for granted rather than given the nurturing and respect it deserves and desperately needs.

Scientists know for certain that these differences exist, but we are not yet sure why. 5 Part of the answer may simply be that in an unhappy marriage people experience chronic, diffuse physiological arousal\u2014in other words, they feel physically stressed and usually emotionally stressed as well. This puts added wear and tear on the body and mind, which can present itself in any number of physical ailments, including high blood pressure and heart disease, and in a host of psychological ones, including anxiety, depression, suicide, violence, psychosis, homicide, and substance abuse. Not surprisingly, happily married couples have a far lower rate of such maladies.

Recently my laboratory uncovered some exciting, preliminary evidence that a good marriage may also keep you healthier by directly benefiting your immune system, which spearheads the body's defenses against illness. Researchers have known for about a decade that divorce can depress the immune system's function. Theoretically this lowering in the system's ability to fight foreign invaders could leave you open to more infectious diseases and cancers. Now we have found that the opposite may also be true. Not only do happily married people avoid this drop in immune function, but their immune systems may even be getting an extra boost. When we tested the immune system responses of the fifty couples who stayed overnight in the Love Lab, we found a striking difference between those who were very satisfied with their marriages and those whose emotional response to each other was neutral or who were unhappy. Specifically, we used blood samples from each subject to test the response of certain of their white blood cells-the immune system's major defense weapons.

It will take more study before scientists can confirm that this boost in the immune system is one of the mechanisms by which a good marriage benefits your health and longevity.

When I first began researching marriage in 1972, you could probably have held all of the \"good\" scientific data on marriage in one hand. By \"good\" I mean findings that were collected using scientific methods as rigorous as those used by medical science. For example, many studies of marital happiness were conducted solely by having husbands and wives fill out questionnaires. This approach is called the self-report method, and although it has its uses, it is also quite limited. How do you know a wife is happy just because she checks the \"happy\" box on some form? Women in physically abusive relationships, for example, score very high on questionnaires about marital satisfaction. Only if the woman feels safe and is interviewed one on one does she reveal her agony.

The sweeping popularity of this approach is easy to understand. When most couples find themselves in a conflict (whether it gets played out as a short spat, an all-out screaming match, or stony silence), they each gird themselves to win the fight. They become so focused on how hurt they feel, on proving that they're right and their spouse is wrong, or on keeping up a cold shoulder, that the lines of communication between the two may be overcome by static or shut down altogether.

Conflict resolution is touted not only as a cure-all for troubled marriages but as a tonic that can prevent good marriages from faltering. Where did this approach come from? The pioneers of marital therapy adapted it from techniques used by the renowned psychotherapist Carl Rogers. For individual psychotherapy Rogerian psychotherapy had its heyday in the 1960s and is still practiced in varying degrees by psychotherapists today. His approach entails responding in a nonjudgmental and accepting manner to all feelings and thoughts the patient expresses. For example, if the patient says, \"I just hate my wife, she's such a nagging bitch,\" the therapist nods and says something like \"I hear you saying that your wife nags you and you hate"

Since marriage is also, ideally, a relationship in which people feel safe being themselves, it might seem to make sense to train couples to practice this sort of unconditional understanding. Conflict resolution is certainly easier if each party expresses empathy for the other's perspective. The problem is that it doesn't work. A Munich-based marital therapy study conducted by Dr. Kurt Hahlweg and associates found that even after employing active listening techniques the typical couple was still distressed. Those few couples who did benefit relapsed within a year. The wide range of marital therapies based on conflict resolution share a very high relapse rate. In fact, the best of this type of marital therapy, conducted by Neil Jacob son, Ph.D.\" of the University of Washington, has only a 35 percent success rate. In other words, his own studies show that only 35 percent of couples see a meaningful improvement in their marriages as a result of the therapy.

It's supposedly the law of the jungle--the male of the species looks to create as many offspring as possible, so his allegiance to any one mate remains superficial. Meanwhile the female, given the large task of tending to the young, looks for a single mate who will provide well for her and her children.

This has been well documented by my extensive research into couples who were not able to save their marriages. Learning about the failures can prevent your marriage from making the same mistakes--or rescue it if it already has. Once you come to understand why some marriages fail and how the Seven Principles could prevent such tragedies, you'll be on the way to improving your own marriage forever. 25 2 How I Predict Divorce How I Predict Divorce Dara and Oliver sit face to face in the Love Lab.

Dara and Oliver are among the fifty who were observed during an overnight stay at the Love Lab \"apartment\". My ability to predict divorce is based in part on my analysis of these couples and their interactions. Dara and Oliver say their lives are hectic but happy. She attends nursing school at night, and he works long hours as a computer programmer. Like many couples, including those who remain content as well as those who eventually divorce, Dara and Oliver acknowledge that their marriage isn't perfect. But they say they love each other and are committed to staying together. They positively beam when they talk about the life they plan to build. I ask them to spend fifteen minutes in the lab trying to resolve an ongoing disagreement they are having while I videotape them. As they speak, sensors attached to their bodies gauge their stress levels 26 based on various measurements of their circulatory system, such as how quickly their hearts beat. I expect that their discussion will be at least somewhat negative."

Dara and Oliver are no exception. Dara thinks Oliver doesn't do his share of the housekeeping, and he thinks she nags him too much, which makes him less motivated to do more. After listening to them talk about this problem, I sadly predict to my colleagues that Dara and Oliver will see their marital happiness dwindle. And sure enough, four years later they report they are on the verge of divorce. Although they still live together, they are leading lonely lives. They have become like ghosts, haunting the marriage that once made them both feel so alive. I predict their marriage will falter not because they argue--after all, I asked them to. Anger between husband and wife doesn't itself predict marital meltdown. Other couples in the newlywed study argue far more during the fifteen minutes of videotaping than do Dara and Oliver. Yet I predict that many of these couples will remain happily married\u2014and they do. The clues to Dara and Oliver's future breakup are in the way they argue. The first sign: harsh startup"

A complaint focuses on a specific behavior, but a criticism ups the ante by throwing in blame and general character assassination. Here's a recipe: To turn any complaint into a criticism, just add my favorite line: \"What is wrong with you?\" Usually a harsh startup comes in the guise of criticism.

Belligerence, a close cousin to contempt, is just as deadly to a relationship. It is a form of aggressive anger because it contains a threat or provocation. When a wife complains that her husband doesn't come home from work in time for dinner, a belligerent response would be:\"Well, what are you going to do about it?\".

When we monitor couples for bodily changes during a tense discussion, we can see just how physically distressing flooding is. One of the most apparent of these physical reactions is that the heart speeds up-pounding away at more than 100 beats per minute--even as high as 165. (In contrast, a typical heart rate for a man who is about 30 is 76, and for a woman the same age, 82.) Hormonal changes occur, too, including the secretion of adrenaline, which kicks in the \"fight or flight response.\" Blood pressure also mounts. These changes are so dramatic that if one partner is frequently flooded during marital discussions, it's easy to predict that they will divorce. Recurring episodes of flooding lead to divorce for two reasons. First, they signal that at least one partner feels severe emotional distress when dealing with the other.

Anthropological evidence suggests that we evolved from hominids whose lives were circumscribed by very rigid gender roles, since these were advantageous to survival in a harsh environment. The females specialized in nurturing children while the males specialized in cooperative hunting. As any nursing mother can tell you, the amount of milk you produce is affected by how relaxed you feel, which is related to the release of the hormone oxytocin in the brain. So natural selection would favor a female who could quickly soothe herself and calm down after feeling stressed. Her ability to remain composed could enhance her children's chances of survival by optimizing the amount of nutrition they received. But in the male natural selection would reward the opposite response. For these early cooperative hunters, maintaining vigilance was a key survival skill.

Just because your marriage follows this pattern, it's not a given that a divorce is in the offing. In fact, you'll find examples of all four horsemen and even occasional flooding in stable marriages. But when the four horsemen take up permanent residence, when either partner begins to feel flooded routinely, the relationship is in serious trouble. Frequently feeling flooded leads almost inevitably to distancing yourself from your spouse. That in turn leads you to feel lonely without help, the couple will end up divorced or living in a dead marriage, in which they maintain separate, parallel lives in the same home. They may go through the motions of togetherness\u2014attending their children's plays, hosting dinner parties, taking family vacations. But emotionally they no longer feel connected to each other."

And yet divorce can so often be predicted by listening to a single conversation between newlyweds. How can this be? The answer is that by analyzing any disagreement a couple has, you get a good sense of the pattern they tend to follow. A crucial part of that pattern is whether their repair attempts succeed or fail. Repair attempts, as I described on page 22, are efforts the couple makes (\"Let's take a break,\" \"Wait, I need to calm down\") to deescalate the tension during a touchy discussion--to put on the brakes so flooding is prevented. Repair attempts save marriages not just because they decrease emotional tension between spouses, but because by lowering the stress level they also prevent your heart from racing and making you feel flooded. When the four horsemen rule a couple's communication, 40 repair attempts often don't even get noticed. Especially when you're feeling flooded, you're not able to hear a verbal white flag.

And since the repair is not heard, the contempt and defensiveness just get heightened, making flooding more pronounced, which makes it more difficult to hear the next repair attempt, until finally one partner withdraws. That's why I can predict a divorce by hearing only one discussion between a husband and wife. The failure of repair attempts is an accurate marker for an unhappy future. The presence of the four horsemen alone predicts divorce with only an 82 percent accuracy But when you add in the failure of repair attempts, the accuracy rate reaches into the 90s. This is because some couples who trot out the four horsemen when they argue are also successful at repairing the harm the horsemen cause. Usually in this situation-- when the four horsemen are present but the couple's repair attempts are successful--the result is a stable, happy marriage. In fact, 84 percent of the newlyweds who were high on the four horsemen but repaired effectively were in stable, happy marriages six years later. But"

Over time he had rewritten his view of their marriage, creating a very negative script. Whenever a conflict arose, he was all set to feel selfrighteous and indignant. His negative thoughts about Leslie helped maintain his distress. He'd get flooded as soon as they had a confrontation. Negative expectations of her and their relationship became the norm.

Here's a little of what they recalled: Rory: I think she was very nervous, and I had some background about why she was nervous, some cultural things that she was trying to live with. And because of this I knew this was going to take a long, long time. So I wasn't nervous at all. I figured this was stage one of a five-year marathon. . . .

This means that they each retained some fundamental sense that the other was worthy of being respected and even liked. 63 If a couple still has a functioning fondness and admiration system, their marriage is salvageable. I'm not suggesting that the road to reviving a marriage as troubled as Rory and Lisa's is easy But it can be done.

Although happily married couples may feel driven to distraction at times by their partner's personality flaws, they still feel that the person they married is worthy of honor and respect. When this sense is completely missing from a marriage, the relationship cannot be revived. Learning from history As it was with Rory and Lisa, the best test of whether a couple still has a functioning fondness and admiration system is usually how they view their past. If your marriage is now in deep trouble, you're not likely to elicit much praise on each other's behalf by asking about the current state of affairs. But by focusing on your past, you can often detect embers of positive feelings. Of course, some marriages do come up empty.

The sense of hope that their marriage can be saved is almost palpable. 70 Exercise 2:The History and Philosophy of Your Marriage Most couples are helped all the more by talking about the happy events of their past. Below is a version of the questionnaire that led Rory and Lisa to reconnect with their fondness and admiration for each other. Completing this questionnaire together will bring you face to face, once again, with the early years of your relationship, and help you remember how and why you became a couple. You will need a few hours of uninterrupted time to complete this exercise. You can ask a close friend or relative to serve as interviewer, or you can just read the questions and talk about them together. There are no right or wrong answers to these questions-- they are merely meant to guide you in recalling the love and perspective on marriage that led you to join your lives in the first place.

This can give couples who thought their marriage was already over the glimmerings of hope that lead them to struggle on to save their relationship.

Although this exercise might sound silly or hokey, it is based on a wide body of research into the power of rehearsing positive thoughts. This approach is one of the tenets of cognitive therapy, which has proven highly successful in helping people overcome depression. When people fall into a depression, their thinking may become disordered--they see everything in an extremely negative light, which just adds to their sense of hopelessness. But if, overtime, they deliberately accustom their mind to a different, positive way of thinking, the sense of hopelessness can be lifted. 73 This exercise is an experiment in offering the same hope to marriage. What you're really doing is rehearsing a more positive way to think about your partner and your relationship. Like any rehearsal, if you do it often enough, the words (and more importantly, the thoughts) will become second nature.

Watching Humphrey Bogart gather teary-eyed Ingrid Bergman into his arms may make your heart 80 pound, but real-life romance is fueled by a far more humdrum approach to staying connected. It is kept alive each time you let your spouse know he or she is valued during the grind of everyday life. Comical as it may sound, romance actually grows when a couple are in the supermarket and the wife says, \"Are we out of bleach?\" and the husband says, \"I don't know. Let me go get some just in case,\" instead of shrugging apathetically. It grows when you know your spouse is having a bad day at work and you take sixty seconds out of your own workday to leave words of encouragement on his voice mail.

As I said, turning toward your spouse in the little ways is also the key to long-lasting romance. Many people think that the secret to reconnecting with their partner is a candlelit dinner or a by-the-sea vacation. But the real secret is to turn toward each other in little ways every day.

He has found that one of the key variables in relapse after his own approach to marital therapy is whether stress from other areas of your lives spills over into your relationship. Couples who are overrun by this stress see their marriages relapse, while those who can help each other cope with it keep their marriages strong. Many couples automatically have this sort of calming-down conversation, perhaps at the dinner table or after the kids fall asleep. But too often this discussion does not have the desired effect--it increases your stress levels because you end up feeling frustrated with your spouse for not listening to you, whether you're the one venting or the one who's offering advice. If that's the case, you need to change your approach to these catch up conversations to make sure they help you calm down. For starters, think about the timing of the chat. Some people want to unburden themselves when they're barely through the door. But others need to decompress on their own for a while before they're ready to interact. So wait until you both want to talk. On a typical"

This is not the time to discuss any conflicts between you. It's an opportunity to support each other emotionally concerning other areas in your lives. This exercise takes active listening, that classic technique of standard marital therapy, and stands it on its head. The goal of active listening is to hear your spouse's perspective with empathy and without judging him or her. That's all well and good. But this 88 approach usually fails because couples are asked to use it when they are airing their gripes with each other. This is difficult to do and often about as painless as an IRS audit. It's virtually impossible not to feel frightened, hurt, or mad as hell when your spouse is blasting you. But I have found that this same listening technique can be extremely beneficial if you use it during discussions where you are not your spouse's target. In this context, you'll feel far freer to be readily supportive and understanding of your spouse and vice versa. This can only heighten the love and trust"

If you quickly suggest a solution to your partner's dilemma, he or she is likely to feel that you are trivializing or dismissing the problem, which backfires. In effect you're saying, \"That's not such a big issue. Why don't you just. ..?\" So the cardinal rule when helping your partner de-stress is that understanding must precede odwce. You have to let your partner know that you fully understand and empathize with the dilemma before you suggest a solution. Often times your spouse isn't asking you to come up with a solution at all--just to be a good listener, or offer a ready shoulder to cry on. I have found a significant gender difference when it comes to this rule. Women are more sensitive to advice-giving than are men. In other words, when a wife tells her husband her troubles, she usually reacts very negatively if he tries to give her advice right away Instead she wants to hear that he understands and feels compassion.

It seems almost 89 too good to be true that you earn points by not trying to solve your partner's problems, but that is the case. 3. Show genuine interest. Don't let your mind or eyes wander.

Accepting influence doesn't mean never expressing negative emotions toward your partner. Marriages can survive plenty of flashes of anger, complaints, even criticisms. Trying to suppress negative feelings in your spouse's presence wouldn't be good for your marriage or your blood pressure. The problem comes when even mild dissatisfaction on the wife's part is met by a barrage from her husband that, instead of toning down or at the most matching her degree of negativity (yelling back, complaining, etc.), goes beyond it.

We see again and again that when the man shares power, the four horsemen aren't so prevalent. In large part this is because his wife is far less likely to use a harsh startup when she's upset.

What husbands can learn from wives Perhaps most importantly, when a husband accepts his wife's influence, his open attitude also heightens the positive in his relationship by strengthening his friendship with his wife. This will make it far easier for him to follow the first three principles: deepening his love map, bolstering fondness and admiration, and turning toward his wife as a matter of course. This occurs not just because the absence of frequent power struggles makes the marriage more pleasurable, but because such a husband is open to learning from his wife. And there's no doubt that women have plenty to teach men about friendship. In his book The Complete Book of Guys, Dave Barry writes about the huge gap between men and women in this regard. He recounts that every year he and his wife get together with some old friends. The wives immediately begin an intense catching-up conversation about their inner feelings. He and the other husband watch the playoffs. The men do get emotional at times--usually when deciding which kind of pizza to order.

But usually women are more emotionally intelligent than their 107 husbands for one simple reason: They've had an enormous head start in acquiring these skills. Observe children at any playground, and you'll see that head start in action. When young boys play (usually run-and-chase games) their priority is the game itself--not their relationship with each other and their feelings. But for little girls, feelings are paramount. A cry of \"I'm not your friend anymore\" will stop a game cold. Whether it starts up again will depend on whether the girls make up.

But whether nature or nurture is the cause of these differences, their effect is undeniable. Because their play emphasizes social interactions and feelings, girls undergo an extensive education into emotions by childhood's end. Boys learn how to pitch overhand. A boy's experience at playing cooperatively and quickly resolving conflicts will be an asset later in the boardroom or on the construction site, but 108 it will be a liability in marriage if it comes at the expense of understanding the emotions behind his wife's perspectives. This difference in training is heightened by the fact that as they get older, boys rarely play with girls, so they miss the chance to learn from them. Although about 35 percent of preschool best friendships are between boys and girls (like Naomi and Eric), by age seven that percentage plummets to virtually 0 percent.

The more vividly you put yourself into each situation, the more effective the exercise will be. No matter how negative you envision your partner as sounding in these scenarios, try to think of the negativity as her way of emphasizing how important this issue is--not as an attack on you. In other words, try to respond to the message, not to your partner's tone of voice. Assume that within that message is a reasonable request with which you could easily agree. In your notebook describe that reasonable request in a sentence. (In some of these scenarios the demand is implied rather than directly spoken.) Then write down what you could say to express your cooperation.

These couples intuitively understand that problems are inevitably part of a relationship, much the way chronic physical ailments are inevitable as you get older. They are like a trick knee, a bad back, an irritable bowel, or tennis elbow. We may not love these problems, but we are able to cope with them, to avoid situations that worsen them, and to develop strategies and routines that help us deal with them. Psychologist Clan Wile said it best in his book After the Honeymoon: \"When choosing a long-term partner\u2026you will inevitably be choosing a particular set of unsolvable problems that you'll be grappling with for the next ten, twenty or fifty years.\" Marriages are successful to the degree that the problems you choose are ones you can cope with.

In unstable marriages, perpetual problems like these eventually kill the relationship. Instead of coping with the problem effectively, the couple gets gridlocked over it. They have the same conversation about it over and over again. They just spin their wheels, resolving nothing. Because they make no headway, they feel increasingly hurt, frustrated, and rejected by each other. The four horsemen become ever more present when they argue, while humor and affection become less so. They become all the more entrenched in their positions.

Telling the difference If you and your spouse are entrenched in conflict, it may not be obvious which of the two types of disagreement you're havinggridlocked or solvable. One way to identify solvable problems is that they seem less painful, gut-wrenching, or intense than perpetual, gridlocked ones.

But lately he's been so distracted by a big deadline looming at work that he forgets. Either Lynn ends up 136 throwing out the garbage herself or the trash just sits there. By morning the apartment smells like a city dump, and Lynn is in a rage. Solvable _____ Perpetual _____ 2. Elise wants to spend less"

But when he does try to tell her when he's upset by some things that she's done, she gets critical about how he has brought them up. She asks him not to mention so many at the same time. He says that since it's so hard for him to discuss such things, he wants a reward when he does: Namely, he wants Amy to say she's sorry instead of criticizing his style of communication. Solvable _____ Perpetual _____ 4. Helena gets together with her friends every Monday night. Jonathan wants her to take a ballroom dancing class together with him, but the only night the class is held is Monday Helena doesn't want to give up her girls' night out.

Solvable _____ Perpetual _____ 137 6. Jim works full time while Thea is a stay-at-home mom. He wants her to be more organized about running the house--to clean it more, and to do a better job of planning the mornings so the kids get to school on time. He acts smug and superior to her and gives her the sense that the disorganization in their house is due to a character flaw she has. She feels attacked and gets defensive whenever he raises the subject. She says their house is supposed to be a home, not an army barracks, and that he needs to relax about these issues because his demands are unreasonable. They have been arguing about this for four years. Solvable _____ Perpetual _____ 7. Whenever Brian and Allyssa have a disagreement, he quickly raises his"

Ever since their baby was born, Kurt has felt that Irene is squeezing him out of her life. She insists on doing all of the child care herself and doesn't seem to have time for him anymore. She has been thinking a lot about her own childhood. (Her parents divorced when she was two and she was shuffled between relatives' homes for years.) She tells Kurt she doesn't want their son Brendan to feel abandoned by her, as she did by her own mother. But Kurt feels betrayed because one of the things he's always loved about Irene is how nurturing and motherly she is toward him. Now that's all being directed at the baby, and he feels cheated.

Anita thinks Bert is stingy about tipping waiters, cab drivers, and so on. This upsets her because part of her image of a strong, sexy man is someone who's generous. When she's disappointed with Bert, she gets very contemptuous of him. Meanwhile, Bert believes that Anita is too loose with their money, which makes him nervous. To him, money represents security and a sense of control over his life, so it's hard to give any of it up. Solvable _____ Perpetual _____ Answers 1. Solvable.

This difference is unlikely to change--they'll need to adjust to it. 3. Perpetual. Ingrid and Gary are engaged in a meta communication war. This means that they aren't having difficulty communicating about a certain issue; they're having difficulty communicating about how to communicate. This is not related to a specific situation but is present whenever they have a disagreement. 139 4. Solvable. Helena and Jonathan can resolve this issue in a number of ways. Perhaps they could switch off weekly between dancing class and Helena's girls' night out. Or maybe her friends would be willing to switch the night.

This problem probably started out as a situational one about housecleaning and organization. Perhaps Jim and Thea have different tolerance levels for clutter, dirt, and how planned out one's life should be. But because they haven't found a compromise position about running their house, they have continued to argue about these differences. Thea has come to feel her husband doesn't value or respect her role, while he feels that she's not holding up her end of the marriage by keeping the household well organized. The argument has become about their mutual resentment rather than about housekeeping. 7. Perpetual. Brian and Allyssa have different emotional styles. He tends to be volatile, meaning that he's very passionate and \"out there\" with his emotions. Allyssa prefers to discuss issues quietly and rationally. When Brian starts yelling at her, she feels overwhelmed and quickly becomes flooded. Since emotional style is part of one's personality neither of them is likely to change.

The huge change in their marriage that was created by their child's birth has thrown what they need from each other out of sync. 140 9. Solvable. Oscar and Mary may have different philosophies about savings. But their conflict over money doesn't appear to be symbolic. Instead, it's a straightforward difference of opinion about what to do with Oscar's inheritance. For that reason, they could probably find a straightforward compromise. Perhaps, for example, they could spend half of the amount on equipment and save the rest. 10. Perpetual. Money has very different meanings to Bert and Anita. Since the symbolic significance of money is usually rooted in childhood experiences, it's unlikely that Bert will naturally transform into a big tipper or that Anita will suddenly learn to love clipping coupons. But if they work together on this perpetual problem (and especially Anita's contempt for her husband about this issue), it will cease to be a major sore spot in their relationship.

The basis for coping effectively with either kind of problem is the same: communicating basic acceptance of your partner's personality Human nature dictates that it is virtually impossible to accept advice from someone unless you feel that that person understands you. So the bottom-line rule is that, before you ask your partner to change the way he or she drives, eats, or makes love, you must make your partner feel that you are understanding. If either (or both) of you feels judged, misunderstood, or rejected by the other, you will not be able to manage the problems in your marriage. This holds for big problems and small ones. You may discover that your partner is more You may discover that your partner is more conciliatory during arguments than you realized- conciliatory during arguments than you realizedonce you know what to listen for. once you know what to listen for.

Would you please slow down before you kill us?\" and \"I know how much you enjoy driving fast. But it makes me really nervous when you go over the speed limit. Could you please slow down?\" Maybe that second approach takes a bit longer. But that extra time is worth it since it is the only approach that works. It's just a fact that people can change only if they feel that they are basically liked and accepted as they are. When people feel criticized, disliked, and unappreciated they are unable to change. Instead, they feel under siege and dig in to protect themselves. Adults could learn something in this regard from research into child development.

Children grow and change optimally when we acknowledge their emotions (\"That doggie scared you,\" \"You're crying because you're sad right now,\" \"You sound very angry. Let's talk about it\") rather than be little or punish them for their feelings (\"It's silly to be afraid of such a little dog,\" \"Big boys don't cry,\" \"No angry bears allowed in this house--go to your room till you calm down\"). When you let a child know that his or her feelings are okay to have, you are also communicating that the child himself or herself is acceptable even when sad or crabby or scared. This helps the child to feel good about himself or herself, which makes positive growth and change possible. The same is true for adults. In order to improve a marriage, we need to feel accepted by our spouse. Another important lesson I have learned is that in all arguments, both solvable and perpetual, no one is ever right.

Many of the older couples I studied with colleagues Bob Levenson and Laura Carstensen in the San Francisco Bay Area were masters at this. They had been married for a very long time--some for more than forty years. Through the course of their marriages, they had learned to view their partners' shortcomings and oddities as amusing parts of the whole package of their spouse's character and personality. One wife, for example, accepted with a chuckle that her husband would never stop being a Dagwood--always running late and frantic. She found ways around it. Whenever they had to get to the airport, she'd tell him their plane left thirty minutes sooner than the actual takeoff time. He knew she was deceiving him, and they laughed about it. Then there was the husband who looked upon his"

Somehow couples such as these have learned to mellow about their partner's faults. So although they communicate to each other every emotion in the spectrum, including anger, irritability, disappointment, and hurt, they also communicate their fundamental fondness and respect. Whatever issue they are discussing, they give each other the message that they love and accept each other, \"warts and all.\" When couples are not able to do this, sometimes the problem is that they are unable to forgive each other for past differences. It's all 155 too easy to hold a grudge. For a marriage to go forward happily, you need to pardon each other and give up on past resentments. This can be hard to do, but it is well worth it. When you forgive your spouse, you both benefit. Bitterness is a heavy burden. As Shakespeare wrote in The Merchant of Venice, mercy is \"twice blessed.

And yet too often couples lose their way when trying to persuade each other or settle disagreements. A conversation that could have been productive instead ends in a screaming match or angry silence. If this sounds like you, and you're certain the problem you want to tackle is indeed solvable (see Chapter 7), then the key to resolving this difficulty is to learn a new approach to settling conflict. (The advice offered here will also be somewhat helpful in coping with gridlocked problems, but it won't be enough. To break the stranglehold a perpetual problem has on your marriage, be sure to read about Principle 6, \"Overcome Gridlock,\" in Chapter 10.) The popular approach to conflict resolution, advocated by many marital therapists, is to attempt to put yourself in your partner's shoes while listening intently to what he or she says, and then to communicate empathetically that you see the dilemma from his or her perspective.

Plenty of the people we studied who had enviable, loving relationships did not follow the experts' rules of communication when they argued. But they were still able to resolve their conflicts.

Be tolerant of each other's faults These steps take very little \"training\" because we all pretty much have these skills already; we just get out of the habit of using them in our most intimate relationship. To a certain degree, my fifth principle comes down to having good manners. It means treating your spouse with the same respect you offer to company. If a guest leaves an umbrella, we say, \"Here. You forgot your umbrella.\" We would never think of saying, \"What's wrong with you? You are constantly forgetting things. Be a little more thoughtful, for God's sake!

The reason for their absence is that Justine's startup is soft. In contrast, a harsh startup usually begins the cycle of the four horsemen, which leads to flooding and, in turn, increased emotional distance and loneliness that lets the marriage wither. Only 40 percent of the time do couples divorce because they are having frequent, devastating fights. More often marriages end because, to avoid constant skirmishes, husband and wife distance themselves so much that their friendship and sense of connection are lost.

Instead she says, \"Going to church is not something I need every day. But it's a comfort.\" Then she tells him, \"I don't like you going just because of me.\" By the time she tells him directly, \"I want a little bit more involvement from you than just Easter, Christmas, and Mother's Day\" he is ready to compromise. \"Okay I'll go to church on big important days and\u2026maybe some Sundays.\" A soft startup doesn't necessarily have to be this diplomatic.

This is all your fault. I just knew you'd be irresponsible about that dog.

Sit in a comfortable chair, or lie on your back on the floor. 179 2. Focus on controlling your breathing. Usually when you get flooded, you either hold your breath a lot or breathe shallowly. So close your eyes and focus on taking deep, regular breaths. 3. Relax your muscles.

When there's conflict in one of these six common areas, usually it's because husband and wife have different ideas about these tasks, 188 their importance, or how they should be accomplished. If the conflict is perpetual, no amount of problem-solving savvy will fix it. The tension will deescalate only when you both feel comfortable living with your ongoing difference. But when the issue is solvable, the challenge is to find the right strategy for conquering it. (If you're not sure whether your conflict is solvable or perpetual, see page 134.) Here we've listed these six hot spots, the task they each represent for a marriage, and practical advice for addressing the solvable disagreements they often trigger. Stress and more stress The task: Making your marriage a place of peace. Most days Stephanie and Todd get home from work within a few minutes of each other. Too often, instead of a loving reunion, they find themselves in a shouting match. Todd, who has been kowtowing to a difficult boss all day, gets annoyed when he can't find the mail because Stephanie moved it off the table for the nth time."

No wonder the days of the cheerful \"Honey, I'm home!\" are history for so many families.

Likewise, if your spouse comes home with a cloud over his head and your \"What's wrong?\" gets answered with a snarl, try not to take it personally. He or she probably just had a bad day. Rather than making the situation worse by lashing out, let it go. Build time to unwind into your daily schedule.

Although mother-in-law jokes told by men are a traditional staple of comedy routines, the real family tension is more frequently between the wife and her mother-in-law. Invariably the differences between the two women's opinions, personalities, and life views become evident the more time they spend together. A decision to go 190 out to dinner can create dissension over such minutiae as where to eat, when to eat, what to eat, how much to spend, who gets the check, and so on. Then, of course, there are the deeper issues of values, jobs, where to live, how to live, how to pray, and whom to vote for. Although such conflicts usually surface quite early in a marriage, in-law difficulties can be triggered or revived at many other times, such as when children are born or pass major milestones in their development, and again as the parents age and become increasingly dependent on the couple.

Unfortunately, this attitude often throws him into the role of peacemaker or mediator, which invariably makes the situation worse. Solution The only way out of this dilemma is for the husband to side with his wife against his mother. Although this may sound harsh, remember that one of the basic tasks of a marriage is to establish a sense of \"we-ness\" between husband and wife. So the husband must let his mother know that his wife does indeed come first. His house is his and his wife's house, not his mother's. He is a husband first, then a son.

Although fantasies are the home of imagination, variety, and adventure in a marriage, very few couples are able to share their fantasies and then find some way of honoring them within their sex life. If you are able to share your fantasies, the result will be great intimacy, romance, and excitement. Try to cultivate the idea that within the boundaries of your marriage, all wishes, images, fantasies, and desires are acceptable. Nothing is intrinsically bad or disgusting. You can say no to your partner's request, but don't disparage it. Expressing a fantasy requires a great deal of trust, so take care to be tender when you hear of a fantasy your partner has. If it's not one of your own, but it's not a turn-off, then agree to it. Don't take it personally if your spouse wants you to pretend to be a stranger, a nurse, or a pirate.

It leads people to base their expectations for their own performance from informal and unreliable sources, mostly those heard from friends during adolescence. The result is often that we judge ourselves quite harshly and feel that we are not very good in bed. For example, many men think that they have to always be able to get an erection whenever the situation calls for it. If it doesn't happen, it is common for great self-doubt to set in. These and many 204 other expectations are things we carry around with us without being very aware of them.

When the husband helps, he feels he should be applauded--but instead his wife keeps demanding he do more, which makes him defensive and likely to do less. A major cause of this unfortunate dynamic is that Greg, like most men, tends to overestimate the amount of housework he does. This has been documented by British sociologist Arm Oakley. I know this is true in my own home. When I complain that I'm doing all of the housework, my wife says, \"Good!\" because she knows that means I'm actually doing half.

Couples are counseled to spend some time away from the baby and focus on their marriage and outside interests: talk about your relationship, your job, her job, the weather, anything but the baby at home. But marriage and family are not diametrically opposed. Rather, they are of one cloth. Yes, the couple should spend time away from the baby occasionally.

But for her husband, a restaurant meal was always much less of a treat than having his very busy mother cook for the 220 family--something she only did on Sundays. So the question of a restaurant versus a home meal is really symbolic of what makes each of them feel loved. When dreams are respected Why do some couples cope"

The difference is that the happy couple understands that helping each other realize their dreams is one of the goals of marriage. \"We want to know what the other person wants in their life,\" says Justine, referring to herself and her husband, Michael. But she could just as well be talking for all emotionally intelligent couples. In happy marriages partners incorporate each other's goals into their concept of what their marriage is about. These goals can be as concrete as wanting to live in a certain kind of house or to get a certain academic degree. But they can also be intangible, such as wanting to feel safe or wanting to view life as a grand adventure. Shelley wants to go to college. Malcolm's hefty paycheck allows her to do that. But he wants to quit his high-pressure marketing job because his dream is to be his own boss and build boats.

The point is that their concept of their marriage incorporates supporting both of these dreams. The way they go about making such decisions--with mutual respect for an acknowledgment of each other's aspirations--is part of what makes their marriage meaningful to them. 221 A horse named Daphne When either spouse doesn't fully appreciate the importance of supporting his or her partner's dreams, gridlock is almost inevitable. That was the root cause of the severe marital problems between Ed and Luanne, a Seattle couple who were interviewed in my Love Lab for Dateline NEC. When Ed and Luanne were in the lab together, you could see that their fondness and affection were still there. But they were experiencing enormous stress over Daphne, Luanne's nine-yearold horse, which she often competed with in horse shows. Before they were married, Ed was very taken with Daphne.

Luanne was told not to give up on her dream and to make sure that Ed understood that he came first in her heart.

The challenge was to respect the dream and each other's needs. But for many couples the dream that is at the core of the conflict is not so obvious. Only by uncovering this dream can the couple get out of gridlock. Take the case of Katherine and Jeff. They were happily married until Katherine became pregnant. Suddenly, it seemed to Jeff, her Catholic faith took on a much more central role in her life. He himself was an agnostic. When he found out that she had been talking with her father about having the baby baptized, he was livid. He did not want his child to have any kind of formal religious instruction.

And since their problem was really an emotional one--concerning their feelings about families, parenthood, and religion--no amount of careful intellectual analysis would be able to resolve it. At their next session, I suggested that instead of trying to solve the issue, they should just listen to each other talk about what religion symbolized to them. This was the only way to get to the hidden dreams that were fueling the conflict. Katherine went first. She described how her beliefs had carried her through very hard times. Her parents went through a rancorous divorce. For ten years her father had no contact with the family. Her mother became so depressed that Katherine couldn't depend on her.

If you've reached gridlock on any issue in your marriage, big or small, the first step is to identify which dream or dreams are fueling the conflict. One good indicator that you're wrestling with a hidden dream is that you see your spouse as being the sole source of the marital problem. If you find yourself saying, for example, that the problem is simply that he is a slob or she is just irresponsible or overly demanding, that's a sign of a hidden dream. It may indicate that you don't see your part in creating the conflict because it has been hidden from view. Uncovering a hidden dream is a challenge.

See the exercises in Chapter 8 (\"Soothe Yourself and Each other,\" ) Step 4: end the gridlock Now it's time to begin the ongoing task of making peace with this issue, accepting the differences between you, and establishing some kind of initial compromise that will help you continue to discuss the problem amicably. Understand that your purpose is not to solve the conflict--it will probably never go away completely 235 instead, the goal is to \"declaw\" the issue, to try to remove the hurt so the problem stops being a source of great pain.

In their first conversation to try to work on this issue, Sally says that her dreams are to pursue pleasure, to be able to truly relax, and to feel unity with nature, all of which she can realize by having a cabin. Although she also fears that Gus wants to turn her into a drone who's living just for tomorrow, she doesn't say this to him now. (She's said it frequently in the past.) Instead, she focuses on what she desires, not her anger and fears connected to Gus. 236 When it's Gus's turn to talk, he tells her that saving money has a lot of symbolic meaning for him.

Although their dreams are still in opposition, they are now motivated to find some common ground, to find a way to respect and perhaps even accommodate both of them. Here's how they do this: 1.

For example, both Ian and Hilary believed that a husband should be a protector and provider and the wife more of a 254 nurturer.

But he knows my weaknesses after 25 years together, noodles being at the top of the list. I overeat and then complain. Instead of judging me, he grabbed a bottle of wine and some dark chocolate (this man really knows me) and sat down at the table to continue our quiet, stay-at-home Valentine\u2019s Day celebration. \u201cSo, who wants to go first?\u201d he asked. Earlier in the day, I told him I wanted to have the first date from John and Julie Gottman\u2019s new book, \u201cEight Dates: Essential Conversations for a Lifetime of Love.\u201d Each date is focused on a topic crucial to a healthy relationship. \u201cI do!\u201d I said,"

Date One is \u201cLean on Me: Trust and Commitment.\u201d Conversation topics include: What does trust and commitment look like in our relationship? How can we make each other feel safe? What are our agreements about trust and commitment? After reading that chapter earlier in the day, I followed the directions in the book and compiled a list of things I cherish about Sean. While there were many things on my list, there were ten that stood out. I envisioned sharing in David Letterman Top 10 List fashion. Trust, Cherishing, and Commitment When you cherish your partner, you feel that they\u2019re irreplaceable. You simply cannot imagine your life without them, even when times are rough. You find ways to tell them that you appreciate them and do that often. This builds trust in the relationship. Cherishing and commitment go together, but they\u2019re different. Commitment is really a verb because it is the actions you take daily to let your partner know we are with them and that you make decisions with them in mind. When you choose commitment, you resist the temptation to betray your partner. You create trust and safety by turning towards"

Can such a thing be measured? It can! Take this free quiz and find out how well you know your partner. Commitment in Action Sean and I have had our share of difficult times, that\u2019s for sure. When our son was a colicky infant, we leaned on each other for support despite being sleep-deprived and cranky with one another. When my mother and beloved dog both died in the same year, I had a hard time shaking off my depression. We argued more than ever and found ourselves in couples counseling. Despite these and other challenges, we never gave up on one another. The thing that sealed the deal for me was when I had a major health crisis 12 years ago. My mysterious illness had my doctors stumped and I was terrified. Our lives were turned upside down for months on end with scary symptoms and no"

It wasn\u2019t until I got a diagnosis and learned to manage my chronic symptoms that I could reflect on how it changed us as a couple. I had been too absorbed in my own fear to recognize how scared my husband was, too. His life was also forever changed. But instead of complaining, he expressed cherishing and commitment by supporting me through my illness in ways that I took for granted at the time. He rubbed my back when I was scared. He drove me to the emergency room in the middle of the night on countless occasions. When I had to change my diet, he joined me. He developed a patience with me that had not been there before. He was less quick to argue over small stuff and he started leaving love notes for me. While he never came out and said it, almost losing me made him realize how much I meant to him. I felt loved and cared for. We now joke that my near-death experience is the secret to our healthy marriage. Thinking Out Loud As I compiled my Top 10 List for our date, I"

I wrote down being comfortable to be myself with Sean and having my faults and bad habits accepted. And that includes eating noodles, knowing full well I will complain about it afterward.
