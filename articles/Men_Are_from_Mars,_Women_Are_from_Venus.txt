Introductio n
 
 
A week after o ur daughter L auren was bor n, my  wife Bo nnie and I were co mpletely  
exhausted. E ach  nig ht L auren kept wak ing  u s. Bonnie had  been torn in t he del ivery  an
d 
was taking  pain killer s. She co uld barely  w alk. After five days o f staying  hom e to help, 
I went back to wor k. She seemed to  be g ettin g  better.
 
 
While I was away she ran o ut o f pain pills. Instead o f calling me at the o ffice, she asked  
o ne o f my  bro thers, 
who was v isiting , to pu rchase mo re. My  bro ther, howev er, did not 
return with the p ill s. Consequently , she sp ent the whole day in pain, taking  care o f a  
newbor n.
 
 
I had no idea t hat he r day had been  so  a wful. When  I ret urne d hom e she  was  v ery  
upset. I mis in
terprete d the cause o f her di st ress and thoug ht she was blaming  me.
 
 
She said, " I' v e been in pain all day.. .. I ran o ut o f pills. I' v e bee n stranded i n bed an d 
nobo dy cares!"
 
 
I said defens ively, " Why  didn't yo u call me? "
 
 
She said, " I asked y o ur bro ther, 
but he fo rg o t! I'v e'  been waiting fo r him to return all 
day. What am I supposed to  do? I can barely  walk. I feel so  deser te d!"
 
 
At this poin t I explo ded. My  fuse was al s o  v ery  shor t that day. I was angr y  that she 
hadn' t called me. I wa s furious that she wa
s  blaming  me when I didn't ev en know she 
was in pain. After exchanging a few harsh wo rds, I headed fo r the doo r. I was fired, 
irritable, and ha d hear d enoug h. We had bo th reached our limit s.
 
 
T hen so mething starte d to  happen that woul d change m y  life.
 
 
Bo n
nie said, " Sto p, pl ease don' t leav e. This is when I need yo u th e mo st. I'm in pain. I 
have n't slept in days. Please li sten to  me."
 
 
I sto pped fo r a mo ment to  lis ten.
 
 
She said, " Jo hn Gray , y o u'r e a fair
-
weather friend! As long  as I' m sweet, lov ing  Bo nnie 
y
o u are here fo r me, but as so o n as I' m no t, yo u walk right o ut tha t do o r."
 
 
T hen she paused,  and  her ey es fil led up wit h tears. As  her tone s h ifted she  said,  " Right 
now I' m in pain. I have  nothing to g iv e, this is when I need y o u the mo st. Please, co me 
ove
r here and hold m e. Y o u don' t have  to say  anything. I j ust  n eed to feel y o ur arms 
aro undme. Please don' t go ."
 
 
I walked o v er and s il ently held her.  She wept in  my  arms. Aft er a few minu tes, she 
thanked me fo r no t leav ing . She to ld me that she ju st needed 
to fe el me ho lding  her.
 
 
At that mo ment I star ted to realize the rea l  meaning o f lov e unco nditio nal lov e. I had 
 
 
6
 
 
alway s tho ught o f my self as a  lov ing  perso n. But she wa s  right. I had  been a 
fair
-
weather friend. As long  as she was happy and nice, I lov ed bac
k. But if she was  
unhappy o r upset, I w o uld feel blamed and then arg ue or  distance  my self.
 
 
T hat day, fo r the first time, I didn't leave her. I stayed, and it felt g reat. I succeeded in 
g iving to her when s he really  needed me.  T his felt  like  real lov e. Car
ing  fo r another 
perso n. T rusting in o u r lov e. Being there at her hour  o f need. I marv elled at how easy  i t 
was fo r me to  support her when I was show n the way .
 
 
Ho w had I missed thi s? She just needed m e to go  ov er and ho ld her. Ano ther wo man 
wo uld have  insti
n ctiv ely  known what Bo nnie needed. But as a m an, I didn't know that 
touching, holding, and listen ing  were so  important to her. By  recog nizing these 
differe nces I bega n to learn a new way  of relating  to my  wife. I wo uld have  never 
believed we co uld res o lve 
co nflict so  eas ily .
 
 
In my  prev ious relationships, I had beco m e indiffere nt and unlo v ing  at difficult times , 
simply  because I did n't know what else to  do. As a result, my  first marr iage had been 
v ery  painful and diffi cult.
 
 
Ibis inc ident with Bo nnie rev eal
ed to  me ho w I could change thi s pattern.
 
 
It ins pired my  sev en y ears o f research  to h elp deve lop and  refi ne the ins ights about  
men and wo men in this boo k. By  learning in v ery practical and  specific terms about 
how men and wo men are differe nt, I suddenly  b
eg an to realize that my  marr iage did 
not need to  be  su ch a  strugg le. With  thi s ne w awarenes s o f o ur d i ffere nces Bo nnie  and I 
were able to impro v e dramatical ly o ur co mmunication and en joy  each other mo re.
 
 
By  co ntinuing to recog nize and explo re o ur differe n
ces we have  disco v ered new way s 
to improv e all o ur relationship s. We have  learned about relationships in way s that o ur 
parents neve r kne w a nd therefo re co uld not have  taug ht u s. As  I  bega n sharing  the se 
insights w ith my  co unselling cl ient s, their  relations
hip s were al so  enriched. L iterally  
tho usands o f tho se who attended my  weekend seminars sa w their relationship s 
dramatical ly transfo rm o v ernight.
 
 
Seve n y ears later in div iduals and co uple s sti ll repo rt su cce ssf ul benefit s. I receiv e 
pictures  o f happy  co u ple
s and their childre n, with  letter s than ki ng me fo r sav ing  thei r 
marr iage. Althoug h their lov e sav ed their marr iage, they  wo uld have  div o rced if they 
hadn' t gained a deepe r understanding o f th e o pposite sex.
 
 
Susan and Jim had be en marr ied nine y ears . L ike 
mo st co uples th ey  started o ut lov ing  
each o ther, bu t after  y ears o f increa sing  fru stration an d di sappoi ntment t hey lost  their  
passion and decided to g ive up. Befo re g etting a div o rce, however, they  attended my 
weekend relat ionship  seminar. Su san s aid , " We 
have  tried ev ery thing  to make thi s  
relationship wo rk. We are just to o  differe nt. "
 
 
During the seminar they  were amazed to learn that their differ ences were not o nly 
nor mal but were to be expected. T hey were co mfo rted that o ther co uples had 
 
 
7
 
 
experienced the 
same  patterns o f relat ing . In just two  days, Sus an and Jim g ained a  
totally new unders tan ding o f men and wo men.
 
 
T hey fell in lov e ag ain. T heir relationsh ip miraculo usly c hanged. No  long er heading 
toward a div o rce, the y  loo ked fo rward to sharing  the rest  o
f th eir liv es tog ether. Jim 
said, " T his info rmatio n about o ur differe nces has g iven me back my  wife. T his is the 
g reatest gift I could ev er receiv e. We are lov ing  each other ag ain."
 
 
Six y ears later, when they  inv ited me to v isit their new hom e and family ,
 
they  still lov e 
each o ther. T hey were still dunk ing  me fo r helping them to understand each o ther and  
stay mar ried.
 
 
Althoug h almo st ev ery o ne wo uld ag ree that men and wo men are differe nt, how 
differe nt is s til l und efined fo r mo st people. Many  boo ks in the 
last ten y ears have  
fo rg ed ahead, attempting to define these differe nces. T houg h impor tant adva nces have  
been made, many  bo o ks are o ne
-
sided and unfo rtunately  reinfor ce mistrus t and 
resentment toward th e o pposite sex.  One se x is g enerally v iewed  as being v
ict imized b y 
the o ther. A defin iti v e g uide was needed  fo r understanding h o w 
h ea lthy  
men and 
wo men are differe nt.
 
 
T o  impro v e relations between the  sexes  it is  necessary  to create an  understand ing  o f o ur 
differe nces tha t raise s self
-
e steem and per so nal dig n
ity  whi le i nspiring  mutual trust , 
perso nal respo nsib ili ty, increased co o peration, and g reater l o v e. As a result o f 
questio ning mo re t ha n 25,000 part icipan ts  i n my  relationsh ip se minars I have  been ab le 
to define in  posit ive terms how men an d wo men are diff
erent.  As y o u explo re thes e 
differe nces y o u wil l feel wall s o f resentme nt and mistr ust mel tin g  down.
 
 
Opening the  heart  res ults  in g reater  fo rg iveness an d in creased  m o tiv ation to g ive and 
receiv e lov e and suppor t. With this new a wareness, y o u will, I  hope,
 
go  beyo nd the 
sugg estio ns in this bo o k and co ntinue to dev elo p way s in which y o u can relate lov ing ly 
to the o pposite sex.
 
 
All o f the  princ iples  i n thi s boo k have  bee n teste d and  tried.  At least 90  percen t o f the  
mo re than 25,000 indiv iduals questio ned h a
v e enthusiasti cally recog nized themselves  
in these descrip tio ns. If y o u find yo urself nodding  y o ur head while reading this boo k, 
say ing , " Y es, y es this is me y o u'r e talking abo ut,"  then y o u are definitely  not alo ne. And 
just as o ther s have  be nefited fro m a
pply ing  the insight s in this bo o k, yo u can as well.
 
 
Men  Are from Ma rs, Wo men  Are from V en u s 
rev eals new strateg i es fo r reducing  ten sio n 
in relationship s and creating mo re lov e by  first recog nizing in g reat detail how men 
and wo men are different. It then o
ffers practica l sugg estio ns about how to reduce 
frustratio n and d isa ppointment and to create in creasing ha ppiness  and in timac y . 
Relationsh ips do not have  to be such a s tru g g le. Only  when we d o  not understand o ne 
another is there ten sio n, resentment, o r con
f lict.
 
 
So many  people are frustrated in t heir relati o nships. T hey lov e their partners, but when  
there is  tens ion the y  do not know wh at to do to make t hings better.  T hro ugh 
 
 
8
 
 
understanding how  c o mpletely  differe nt m en and wo men are, y o u wil l learn  new way s 
f
o r successful ly relati ng with, listeni ng to, and supporting the opposite sex. Y o u will 
learn how to create th e lov e y o u deserv e. As y o u read this boo k y o u may  wo nder ho w 
anybo dy succeeds in having  a succes sful re lationship withou t it.
 
 
Men  Are from Ma rs, W
o men  Are from V en u s 
is a manua l fo r lov ing  relationship s in th e 
1990s. It rev eals how men and wo men differ in all areas o f their l ives. No t o nly  do men 
and wo men co mmunicate differe ntly but th ey  think, feel, perceiv e, react, respo nd, lov e, 
need, and apprec
iate  differe ntly. T hey almo st seem to be from differe nt planets, 
speaking different lan g uage s and needing different no urishment.
 
 
T his expanded understanding o f o ur differences helps resolve much o f the frustratio n 
in deali ng with  and tr y ing  to understand  
th e o pposite sex. Mi sun derstandings  can then 
be quickly  di ss ipated o r av o ided. Inco rrect expectations  are easi l y  co rrected. When y o u 
remem ber that y o ur partner is as d ifferent fro m y o u as so meo ne fro m another planet, 
y o u can relax and  co o perate wi th the  di
ffer ences instead  o f resi st ing  o r trying to chang e 
them.
 
 
Mo st important, thro ugho ut this boo k y o u will learn pra cti cal t echniques fo r so lving 
the pro blems that aris e fro m o ur differe nces. T his boo k is not just a theo retical analy si s 
o f psy cholo g ical diffe
rences bu t al so  a pra c tical  manual  fo r how to suc ceed i n crea ting 
lov ing  relationships.
 
 
T he truth o f these  principle s is  self
-
ev i dent and  can  be v a lidated  by y o ur o wn 
experience as we ll as  by co mmo n sense. Many  examples will simply  and co nci sely  
express w
ha t y o u have  alway s intui tiv ely  known. T his v alidat ion will a ssi st y o u i n 
being y o u and in not lo sing  y o urself in y o ur relationship s.
 
 
In respo nse to these insights, men o ften say , "T his is exactly  how I am. Hav e y o u been 
fo llo wing  me aro und? I no  lo nger  f
eel like so mething is wrong  wi th me."
 
 
Wo men o ften say , " Finally my  husband listens to me. I don' t have  to fight to be 
v alidated. When yo u explain our  differe nces , my  husband underst ands. Thank y o u!"
 
 
T hese are but a few o f the tho usands o f inspiratio na l c
o mments that people have  
shared after learning  that men are fro m Mars and wo men are from Venus. T he results 
o f this new pro g ram fo r understanding t he o pposite sex are not o nly  dramatic and 
immediate but a lso  lo ng lasting.
 
 
Certainly  the journey  o f creating
 
a lov ing  relationship can be ro cky at times. Pro blems 
are inev itable. But the se pro blems either ca n be so urces o f resent ment and rejectio n o r 
can be o ppor tuni ties f o r deepening  intima c y  and increas ing  lov e, caring, and trust. T he  
insights o f th is boo k  are
 
not a " quick fix "  to eliminate all  pr o blems. Instead they 
pro v ide a new approach whereby  y o ur relationship s can suc ces sfully  support y o u in 
so lving life' s pro blem s as they  arise.  With  t his new  awarene ss y o u wil l have  the  too ls  
y o u need to g et the lov e y o u
 
deserv e and to g ive yo ur partner the lov e and support he 
o r she deserv es.

I make many g eneralizations about men and wo men in this boo k. Pro bably  y o u will 
find so me co mments  truer than o thers ...  after all, we are uni que indiv idual s w ith  
unique experience
s. S o metimes in my  semi nar co uples and indiv iduals w ill share that 
they  relate to the exa mples o f men and wo men but in an o pposi t e way . T he man relate s 
to my  descriptio ns o f wo men and the wo man relates to my  descriptio ns o f men. I call 
this ro le rever sal.
 
 
If y o u disco v er y o u are experiencing  ro le rev ersal, I want to assure y o u that ev ery thing 
is all right. I sugg est  that when y o u do not relate to so methin g  in this boo k, either 
igno re it (mov ing  o n to so mething y o u do relate to) o r loo k d eeper inside  y o urse
lf. 
Many  men have  deni ed so me o f their mas culine a ttribu tes in o rder to beco me mo re 
lov ing  and nurturing. L ikewise many  women have  denied some o f their feminine 
attribute s in o rder to earn a liv ing  in a wo rk fo rce that rewards masculine  attrib utes. If 
this
 
i s the case, t hen  by apply ing  the sugg estio ns, strateg ie s, and technique s in thi s  
boo k y o u not o nly  will create mo re pas sion in y o ur relatio nships b ut al so  will 
increasingly  balan ce y o ur masculine and fe minine chara cteris tic s.
 
 
In this boo k I do not direc
tly  addres s t he questio n o f 
wh y  
men and wo men are 
differe nt. T his i s a co mplex questio n to w hich there are many  answers, rang ing  fro m 
bio log ical differe nce s, parental inf luence , education, and bir th o rder to cultural  
co nditio ning by so cie ty, the media, and
 
hi story . (These issue s a re explo red in g reat 
depth in my  boo k 
Men , Wo men , an d  Relation sh ips: Ma k ing P ea ce with th e Op p o site 
S ex.)
 
 
Althoug h the benefi t s o f apply ing  the  in si g hts in thi s boo k are immediate, this  boo k 
does not replace the need fo r therapy  a
nd co unselling fo r troubled relationshi ps o r 
surv ivo rs o f a dysfu nctio nal  family . E v en healthy  indiv idua ls may  need therapy  o r  
co unselli ng at chal le nging  times. I belie v e strong ly in the p o werful and g radual 
transfo rmatio n that o ccurs in therapy , mar riage 
co unselling, and twelv e
-
step recov er y 
g ro ups.
 
 
Y et repeatedly  I have  heard people say  tha t they  have  benefite d  mo re fro m this new 
understanding o f rela tio nship s than fro m y ears o f therapy . I how ev er believe that t heir 
y ears o f therapy  o r recov ery  wo rk prov
ided the g ro undwo rk that allowed them to apply 
these in sights so  succ essfully  to  the ir life a nd relationsh ips.
 
 
If o ur past was dysfunctio nal, then ev en a fter y ears o f therapy  o r attending recov ery 
g ro ups we still need a positiv e picture o f healthy  relatio

Marti ans val ue pow er, competency, effi ciency, and achi evement . They are al ways doi ng t hi ngs

Ever ythi ng on Mars i s a ref lecti on of t hese val ues. Even t hei r dres s i s desi gned t o refl ect  t hei r

They don't read magazines l i ke Psychol ogy Today, Self, or

They are more concerned

They are more i nt erest ed i n "obj ects" and "t hi ngs" rat her t han peopl e and feeli ngs. Even t oday

A chieving goals i

U nderst andi ng t his Mart i an charact eri sti c can hel p w omen underst and w hy men resi st  so much

H owever, i f he t rul y does need help, t hen it  i s a si gn of wi sdom t o get i t . In t hi s cas e, he w ill

This  Marti an cust om is one of t he reasons men i nsti nct i vel y off er sol uti ons w hen w omen t al k

LI FEO N VENU S
 
 
V enusi ans have diff erent values. They val ue love, communicati on, beauty, and rel at i onshi ps. 
They spend a l ot of ti me supporti ng, helpi ng, and nurt uri ng one anot h

defi ned t hrough t hei r feel i ngs and t he qual it y of t hei r rel ati onshi ps. They experi ence 
ful fi lment t hroughsharing and relat i ng.
 
 
Ever ythi ng on V enus refl ect s t hese val ues. R ather t han bui l ding highw ays and t all  bui l di ngs, 
t he V en
usi ans are more concerned w it h li ving t oget her i n harmony, community, and l ovi ng 
cooperati on. R el at i onshi ps are more import ant  t han w ork and technology. In most  w ays t heir 
w orl d i st he opposi te ofMars .
 
 
They do not  w ear unif orms  l i ket he Mart i ans ( t oreve
al  t hei r c ompetence) . O n the contrar y, they 
enjoy w eari ng a different  out fi t  every day, acc ording t o how  t hey are feel i ng. Personal 
expressi on, especi al l y of t hei r feel i ngs, i s very import ant . They may even change outfit s several 
t i mes a dayast heir mood

Communicati on i s of pri mary i mport ance. To share t hei r personal feel i ngs is much more 
i mport ant t han achi evi ng goal s and success . Talking and rel at i ng t o one anot her i s a source of 
t remendous f ul fi ll ment .
 
 
 
17
 
 
 
This  is hard for a man t o comprehend. H e
 
can come cl ose t o unders t andi ng a w oman's 
experi ence of shari ng and relat i ng by comparing i t t o t he sat i sfact i on he feel s w hen he w i ns a 
rac e, achi eves a goal , orsol vesa problem.
 
 
Inst ead of being goal ori ented, w omen are relati onshi p oriented; t hey are
 
more concerned w it h 
expressi ng t hei r goodness , l ove, and cari ng. Tw o Marti ans go t o l unch t o discuss a project or 
busi ness goal ; t hey have a probl em t o sol ve. In addi ti on, Mart ians view goi ng t o a rest aurant  as 
an eff ici ent  w ay t o approach food: no shoppi

V enusi ans, goi ng t o l unch is an opport unit y t o nurt ure a relati onshi p, for bot h givi ng support 
t o and rec ei ving support  fr om a fri end. Women's res taurant  t al k can be very open and i nt imat e, 
al most  li ket he dial ogu
e t hat occ urs betw eent herapi st  and pat i ent .
 
 
O n V enus, everyone st udies  psychol ogy and has at  l east  a mast er's degree i n counsel i ng. They 
are very i nvol ved i n personal growt h, spi ri t ual ity, and everyt hi ng t hat  can nurt ure l i fe, heal i ng, 
and growt h.V enus 
i s c overed wi t h parks, organi c gardens, shoppi ng center s,and rest aurants .
 
 
V enusi ans are very intui ti ve. They have devel oped t his abi li t y t hrough cent uries of 
anti ci pat i ng t he needs of others. They pri de t hems el ves i n bei ng considerat e of t he needs and 
fe
eli ngs of ot hers. A  sign of great l ove is t o offer help and ass ist ance t o anot her V enusi an 
w it hout bei ng asked.
 
 
Bec ause provi ng one's competence i s not as import ant  t o a V enusi an, offeri ng help i s not

A  man, however, may feel  offended 
becausew hen aw omanoffer s advice he doesn't feel she mi st s his abil it y t o do it  hims el f.
 
 
A  w oman has no concepti on of t hi s mal e sensit i vit y because for her i t  i s anot her feat her i n her

For example, Tom and Mary w ere goi ng t o a part y. Tom w as dri ving. A fter about t w ent y

From his si de, he w as off ended. What  he heard w as "I don't  t rust  you to get us t here. You are

Wi t hout  know i ng about l ife on Mars, Mary could not  appreci ate how  import ant  i t w as f

Mary had no i dea t hat w hen Tom became l ost  and start ed ci rcl i ng t he sam e block, it  w as a very

A fter learni ng about Marti ans and V enusi ans, Mary l earned how t o support  Tom at  such

G eneral l y speaki ng, w hen a w oman offers unsoli ci t ed a

For exampl e, Mary comes  home fr om an exhaust i ng day. She w ants and needs t o share her

Mary angri l y says, "I am not  alw ays unhappy. Can't you just l ist ent o me?"
 
 
Tom says, "Iaml i st eni ng."
 
 
Mary says, "Why do Ieven bother?"
 
 
A fter t hi s conversati on, Mary w as mo

Tom had no i dea t hat  j ust  li st eni ng wi t h

When Mary now comes home t ired and exhausted t hei r convers at i

Mary says, "Therei s s omuch t o do. I have no time f orme."
 
 
Tom t akes a deep breath, rel axes on t he exhal e, and says, "H umph, sounds Ii i ke you had a hard

Tom gives Mary a hug and she relaxes i n his  arm s w it h a big si gh of rel ief. She t hen says, "I

You probably can recognize t hi s sit uati on because it  i s j ust  one of many exampl es w here men

Sol ving t his problem for Tom and Mary depends n

Wi t hout  knowi ng t hat  w omen reall y do need to t al k about  probl ems to feel  bet t er, Tom w ould

These tw o diff erences can be res ol ved by fi rst  underst andi ng i n greater detai l  how  men and

When a man i s stressed he w i l l  w it hdraw  i nto t he cave of his  mi nd and focus on sol ving a

H i s ful l  aw areness  is not  present  because he is mul li ng over his probl em, hoping t o fi nd a

H owever, i f he cannot  fi nd a sol uti on t o hi s problem , t hen he remai ns st uck i n t he cave. To get

H OW WO MEN R EA CT TO  THE CAV E
 
 
When
 
a man i s st uck i n his cave, he i s pow erl ess  t o give hi s part ner t he quali t y att enti on she 
deserves. It  i s hard for her t o be accepti ng of him at  t hese ti mes because she doesn't  know  how 
st ress ed he i s. If he w ere t o come home and t al k about al l  his  probl e
ms, t hen she could be more 
compassi onat e. Inst eadhe doesn't t al k about  his problems , and she feels he i s i gnori ng her. She 
can tell  he i s upset  but  mi st akenl y assumes he doesn't care about  her because he i sn't  t al ki ng to 
her.
 
 
Women generall y do not  underst and how  Martians cope w it h st ress. They expect  men t o open 
up and t al k about all  t hei r probl ems  t he w ay Venusi ans do. When a man i s st uck i n hi s cave, a 
w oman resents his not being more open. She feel s hurt  w hen he t urns on t h
e new s or goes 
out si de t o pl ay some basket bal l  andi gnores her.
 
 
To expect  a man w ho is i n hi s cave i nst ant l y t o become open, res ponsi ve, and l ovi ng is as 
unreali sti c as expect i ng a w oman w ho i s upset  imm edi at el y t o calm dow n and make complete 
sense. It i s
 
a mist ake t o expect a man t o al ways be i n t ouch wi t h his l ovi ng feeli ngs j  ust  as i t is 
a mist aket o expect  a w oman'sfeeli ngst o alw ays be rati onal and l ogi cal .
 
 
When Marti ans go t o t hei r caves t hey t end t o forget  t hat  t hei r fri ends may be havi ng probl em
s 
t oo. A n i nsti nct  t akes over t hat says before you can t ake care of anybody el se, you must  firs t 
t ake care of yourself. When a w oman sees a man react  i n t hi s w ay, she generall y resist s it  and 
res ents t he man.
 
 
She may ask for hi s support  i n a demandi ng t on
e, as i f she has t o fi ght for her ri ght s w it h t his 
uncar i ng man. By rememberi ng t hat men are from Mars, a w oman can corr ect l y i nt erpret  his 
reac ti on t o st ress as his coping mec hani sm rat her t han as an express i on of how  he feel s about 
her. She can begint o 
cooperat ew it h hi mt o get w hatshe needs i nst eadof resi sti ng hi m.
 
O n t he ot her si de, men generall y have l it tl e awareness  of how  di st ant they become w hen t hey 
are i n t he cave. A s a man rec ogni zes how  w it hdrawi ng i nto his cave may aff ect w omen, he can 
be co
mpassi onate w hen she feel s neglect ed and uni mportant. R ememberi ng t hat w omen are 
fr om Venus helps him  to be more underst andi ng and res pectful  of her reac ti ons and feel i ngs. 
Wi t hout  underst andi ng t he vali di t y of her react i ons, a man commonly defends himself
, and 
t hey argue. These are five common mi sunderstandi ngs:
 
 
1. When shesays "You don't  li sten," he says "What  do you mean I don't  list en. I cant ell  you 
everythi ng you sai d."
 
 
When a man i s i n t he cave he can rec ord w hat  she i s sayi ng w it h t he 5 percent  o
f mi nd t hat is 
l i st ening. A  man reas ons t hat i f he is l ist eni ng w i th 5 percent , t hen he i s li stening. H owever, 
w hatshe is as ki ng for i s his  ful l  undi vided att ent i on.
 
 
2. When she says "I feel l i ke you are not  even here," he says "What  do you mean I' m not  
here? 
O f c ours eI am  here. Don't you see my body?"
 
 
H e reasonst hati f hi s body i s present t henshe shouldn'tsay hei s nott here. H ow ever, t hough 
 
 
27
 
 
his  body is present ,shedoesn't feel  hi sfull  presence, andt hati sw hatshe means.
 
 
3. When she says "You d
on't  care about  me," he says "O f cours e I care about you. Why do you 
t hink Iamt ryi ng to sol ve t his problem? "
 
 
H e reasonst hat becausehe is  preoccupi edw i t h solvi ng a problem t hat wi l l i n somew ay benefit  
her, she shoul d know  he car es for her. H ow ever, s
he needs t o feel  his  dir ect  at t ent i on and 
car i ng,and t hat  is w hat she i sreal l y aski ngfor.
 
 
4. When shesays "Ifeel l i keI am  not  import antt o you," he says "That's ri dic ul ous.O fcourse 
you are import ant."
 
 
H e reas ons t hat  her feel i ngs are i nvali d beca
use he i s sol vi ng problems  t o benefit  her. H e 
doesn't  reali ze t hat  w hen he focuses  on one problem  and ignores t he probl ems  she i s bot hered 
by t hat  al most any w oman w oul d have t he same react i on and t ake i t personall y and feel 
uni mport ant.
 
 
5. When she says 
"You have no feel i ngs. You are i n your head," he says "What's wrong wi th 
t hat? H ow  el se do you expect me t osol ve t hi s probl em? "
 
 
H e reas ons t hat  she i s bei ng t oo cri ti cal  and demandi ng because he i s doi ng some
t hing t hat  is 
ess enti al  for hi m t o solve probl ems . H e feels unapprec iat ed. In addi ti on he doesn't  rec ogni ze 
t he vali di t y of her feelings Men generall y don't  reali ze how  ext remel y and qui ckl y t hey may 
shi ft  fr om bei ng w arm and feel i ng t o being unres ponsi ve 
and dist ant . In his  cave a man is 
preoccupi ed wi t hsol vi ng hi s probl em and is unaw are of how  his i ndifferent  at ti t udemi ght  feel 
t o ot hers .
 
 
To i ncrease cooperati on bot h men and w omen need t o underst and each other bet t er. When a 
man begi ns t o i gnore hi s w i
fe, she oft en takes i t personall y. Know i ng t hat  he is copi ng wi th 
st ress  i n his  ow nw ay isext remel y helpful  but does not  al ways hel p heral l evi ate t he pai n.
 
 
A t such ti mes s hemay feel  t he need t o t al k about t hese feel i ngs. Thi s i s w hen it  is import antfo
r 
t he man t o val i dat e her feeli ngs. He needs t o unders t and t hat she has a ri ght  t o t al k about  her 
feeli ngs of bei ng i gnored and unsupport ed j ust  as he has a ri ght  t o w it hdraw  i nto his cave and 
not  t al k. If she does notfeel  unders t ood t heni t is di ffi cul t  
for her t orel ease her hurt .
 
 
FIN DIN G R ELIEF THRO UGH  TALK ING
 
 
When a w oman i s stressed she i nsti ncti vely feel s a need t o t al k about her feeli ngs and al l t he 
poss i bl e probl ems  t hat are ass oci at ed wi t h her feeli ngs. When she begins t al king she does not 
pri or

sm all . She is not  imm ediat el y concerned wi t h fi ndi ng sol uti ons t o her probl ems  but  rat her 
seeks reli ef by expressi ng herself and bei ng underst ood. By randoml y t
al ki ng about  her 
probl ems, s he becomesless  upset .
 
 
A s a man under stres s tends t o focus on one probl em and forget  ot hers, a w oman under st ress 
t ends t o expand and become overw hel med by al l  problems . By t alking about all  possi ble 
probl ems wi t hout  focusi ng

i n t hi s process she gai ns a great er aw areness  of w hat i s real l y bot heri ng her, and t hen suddenl y 
she i s no l onger s o overw helmed.
 
 
 
 
28
 
 
To feel  bett er, w omen t al k about past  probl ems , fut ure pr
oblems , potenti al  probl ems, even 
probl ems t hat have no solut i ons. The more t al k and explorati on, t he bett er t hey feel . This is t he 
w ayw omen operate. Toexpect  ot herw ise is t o deny a w oman hersense of s elf.
 
 
When a w oman is overw hel med she fi nds rel i ef t h
rough t al ki ng i n great  det ail  about  her 
vari ous problems. G raduall y, i f she feel s s he is  being heard, her st ress  dis appears . A ft er t al king

not  be i n any order and t end t o be l ogi call y unrel at ed. If she feel s she is not being underst ood, 
her awareness may expand even furt her, and she may become upset  about m ore problems .
 
 
Just  a
s a man w ho i s st uck i n t he cave needs l i tt le probl ems t o di st ract  hi m, a w oman w ho 
doesn't  feel  heard wi ll  need t o t al k about ot her probl ems t hat  are less  imm edi at e t o feel  rel i ef. 
To forget  her own pai nful  feel i ngs she may become emot i onal l y i nvolved i n

t al ki ng is a nat ural andhealt hyV enusi anreact ion t o stress.
 
 
H OW MEN R EA CT WH EN  WO MEN N EED TO  TALK
 
 
When w omen t al k about  probl ems, men usually resi st . A  man ass umes she i s t al king w i t h him 
about her probl ems  because she is hol ding him res ponsi bl e. The more probl ems, t he more he 
feel s blamed. H e does not real i ze t h
at  she i s t alking t o feel  bett er. A  man doesn't  know  t hat she 
w il l  appreci at ei t i f he just  li st ens.
 
 
Marti ans t al k about probl ems  for onl y tw o reasons: t hey are bl aming someone or t hey are 
seeki ng advi ce. If a w oman i s reall y upset  a man ass umes she i s bl
ami ng him . If  she seems  l ess 
upset ,t hen he ass umesshe i saski ng for advi ce.
 
 
If  he ass umes she i s aski ng for advice, t hen he put s on his  Mr Fi x
-
It  hat t o sol ve her probl ems . 
If  he ass umes  she i s blami ng him, t hen he draw s his sw ord t o prot ect him sel f from at t ack. In 
bot h cases, hesoon fi nds i t  di ffi cul t t o li st en.
 
 
If  he off ers  sol uti ons t o her probl ems, she j ust  conti nues tal ki ng about more prob
lems . Aft er 
offeri ng t wo or t hree sol uti ons, he expect s her t o feel  bett er. This i s because Mart i ans 
t hemsel ves feel  bett er w it h sol ut i ons, as l ong as t hey have asked for a sol uti on t o be offer ed. 
When she doesn't  feel  better, he feel s hi s sol uti ons have b
een rej ect ed, and he feels 
unapprec iat ed.
 
 
O n t he ot her hand, i f he feel s at tacked, t hen he begi ns t o defend hi ms el f. H e t hi nks i f he 
explai ns hims el f t hat she w il l  st op bl ami ng him. The more he defends himself, however, t he 
more upset  she becomes. H e does
n't  real ize t hat explanat i ons are notw hat  she needs. She needs 
him  t o unders tand her feel i ngs and l et  her move on t o t al k about  more probl ems. If  he i s w i se 
and l ust  l ist ens, t hen a few moments aft er she i s compl ai ni ng about  him, she w il l  change t he 
subje
ct  andt al k about  ot her probl ems  asw el l .
 
 
Men also become parti cular l y fr ust rat ed w hen a w oman t al ks about problems t hat  he can do 
not hing about . For example, w hen aw omani s stres sedshe coul d compl ai n:

nt  Loui sei s get t i ng sicker andsicker, each yearshe get s si cker."

A  w oman might  make any of t he above comm en
t s as a w ay of expressi ng her w orri es, 
dis appoint ments , and frust rat i ons. She may know  t hat  not hing more can be done t o sol ve t hese 
probl ems, but  t o fi nd rel ief she sti ll  needs to t al k about  t hem. She feels support ed i f t he 
l i st ener relat es t o her frust rat

part ner
-
unless  he underst andst hat shej ust  needs t o tal k about  it  andt hen she wi ll  feet  bet t er.
 
 
Men al so become i mpati ent  w hen w omen t al k about  probl ems  in great  detail . A  man 
mi st akenl y ass um

for him t o fi nd a sol ution t o her probl em. H e st ruggl es t o fi nd t hei r rel evance and .becomes 
i mpat i ent . A gai n he doesn't  real ize t hat she i s l ooking not  for a sol ution fr om him  b
ut for his 
car i ngand underst anding.
 
 
In addi ti on, li stening is dif ficult  for a man because he mist akenly assumes t here is a l ogical 
order w hen she randoml y changes fr om one probl em t o anot her. A fter she has shared t hree or 
four probl ems  he becomes  extreme
l y fr ust rat ed and confused t ryi ng l ogi cal l y t o rel at e t hese 
probl ems.
 
 
A not her reason a man may resist li stening i s that he is l ooking for t he bott om li ne. H e cannot 
begi n form ul at i ng his sol uti on unt il  he knows t he out come. The more detail s she gives t he 
more he is frust rat ed whil e l ist eni ng. Hi s fr ust rat i on i s l ess ened i f he can remem ber t hat she i s 
greatl y benefi ti ng by tal king about  t he details. If  he can remem ber t hat tal king i n detai l  i s 
helpi ng her t o feel  good, t hen he can rel ax. Just  as a man i s fu
l fi ll ed through w orki ng out  t he 
i ntri cat e det ail s of sol ving a probl em, a w oman i s ful fi ll ed t hrough t al ki ng about  t he detail s of

Somet hi ng a w oman can do t o make it  a li tt l e easi er for a man is t o l et  him  know  i n advance t he

Many men and even women are very j udgmen

Centuri es before t he Mart ians and V enusi ans got t oget her t hey had been qui te happy li ving i n 
t heir sepa
rate w orl ds. Then one day everyt hing changed. The Mart i ans and V enusi ans on t heir 
res pect i ve planet s suddenly became depressed. It  w as t his depressi on, how ever, t hat  moti vated 
t hem eventual l yt o come t oget her.
 
 
U nderst andi ng t he secret s of t hei r t ransf orma
ti on helps us t oday t o recogni ze how  men and 
w omen are mot i vat ed in dif ferent ways. Wi t h this  new aw areness you w il l  be bett er equi pped 
t o support  your part ner as w el l  as get  t he support  you need at  di ffi cul t  and st ressf ul  t imes . Let's 
go back int ime and 
pretend t o wi t ness w hat  happened.
 
 
When t he Mart i ans became depressed, everyone on t he planet  l eft  t he ci ti es and w ent  t o t hei r 
caves for a l ong t ime. They w ere st uck and coul dn't  come out , unt i l  one day w hen a Mart i an 
hap
pened t o gli mpse t he beaut iful  V e
nusi ans through his  t el esc ope. As he qui ckl y shared his 
t el esc ope, t he si ght of t hese beauti ful bei ngs i nspi red t he Mart i ans, and t hei r depress i on 
mi racul ousl y li ft ed. 
Suddenly they f el t needed. 
They cam e out  of t hei r caves and began buddi ng 
a fl eet  ofspa
ceshi pst o fl y toV enus.
 
 
When t he V enusi ans becam e depressed, t o feel  bett er t hey form ed circl es and began t al ki ng 
w it h one anot her about t heir prob
l ems. But  t hi s di dn't  seem t o reli eve t he depressi on. They 
st ayed depressed for a long t ime unt il  t hrough their  i ntui ti on t hey expe
ri enced a vi si on. St rong 
and w ondrous bei ngs ( the Mart i ans)  w oul d be comi ng acr oss  t he uni vers e t o l ove, serve, and

Suddenl y they fel t cher ished. As 
they shared t hei r visi on t heir depres
si on l i ft ed, 
and t hey happi l y beganprepari ng fort he arr i val of t heMart i ans.
 
 
These secr et s of mot i vat i on are sti ll  appl i cabl e. Men are moti
vated and empow ered 
w hen they 
f eel  n
ee ded. 
When a man does not  feel  needed i n a rel ati onshi p, he gradual l y becomes passi ve 
and l ess energized; w ith each passi ng day he has l ess  t o gi ve t he relat i onshi p. O n t he ot her 
hand, w hen he feels t rust ed t o do his  best  t o fulfi ll  her needs and appreci a
ted for his  effort s, he 
i s empowered and hasmoret o gi ve.
 
 
Li ke t he Venusi ans, w omen are moti vated and empowered 
w hen they f eel  cherished. 
When a 
w oman does not  feel cherished i n a rel at ionshi p she graduall y becomes compul sively 
res ponsi ble and exhaust ed 
fr om givi ng t oo much. O n t he other hand w hen she feels cared for 
and res pect ed,she is f ulfi ll ed and has m ore t o give as well .

A fter t he fi rst Mart i an fell  i n l ove, he began manufact uri ng t el esc opes for all  hi s brot her

The strange and beauti ful V enusians w ere a myst eri ous att racti on t o t he Mart i ans. Their 
dif ferences especi all y at t ract ed t he Mart i ans Where t he Marti ans were hard, t he Venusi ans 
w ere soft . Where t he Mart ians w ere angular, t he V enusi ans were roun

w ere cool , t he V enusi ans were w arm . In a magical  and perf ect  w ay t heir diff erences seemed to 
compl ement  each ot her.
 
 
In an unspoken l anguage t he V enusi ans communic at ed l oud and cl ear: "We need you. Your 
pow er and st rengt h can bri ng us
 
great  fulfil  fil li ng a voi d deep w i t hi n our being. Toget her we 
could li vei n great  happiness." This i nvit ati onmoti vat ed and empowered the Marti ans.
 
 
Many w omen i nsti nct ively underst and how  t o give t hi s mess age. In t he begi nni ng of a 
rel at i onshi p, a w oman
 
gives a man a bri ef l ook t hat says you could he t he one t o make me

The Marti ans were very mot i vat ed by t he possi bil it y of maki ng a diff erence on V enus. The

The Marti ans began buil ding a fl eet  of spaces hips t hat  w oul d carr y t hem acr oss  t he heavens t o

Sim il arl y, w hen a man i s i n l ove he i s moti vat ed t o be t he best  he can be i n order t o ser ve 
others . When
 
his heart  i s open, he feels so confi dent  i n hims el f t hat he i s capable of maki ng 
maj or changes. G i ven the opport unit y t o prove his  pot enti al , he express es his best  sel f. O nly 
w hen he feels he cannot succeed does heregress back to hi s ol d sel fishw ays.
 
 
W
hen a man i s i n l ove, he begi ns t o car e about  anot her as much as hims elf. H e is suddenly 
rel eased fr om t he bi nding chai ns of being mot ivated for hims el f al oneand becomes f ree t o gi ve 
t o anot her, not  for personal gai n, but  out  of caring. H e experi ences  hi s
 
part ner's ful fi lment  as if 
i t  w ere his own. H e can easil y endure any hardshi p t o make her happy because her happi ness 
makes hi m happy. Hi s st ruggles become easi er.H e is energi zedw it h a hi gher purpose.
 
 
In his youth he can be sat i sfi ed by servi ng himsel f
 
al one, but  as he matures sel f
-
grat ifi cati on is 
no l onger as sati sf yi ng. To experi ence fulfi lment he must begi n t o l i ve his  l ife mot ivated by

devoid of cari ng for others s. Al t hough he st il l needs t o recei ve l ove, his 
great est  need is t o gi ve love.
 
 
Most  men are not  onl y hungry t o gi ve l ove but are st arvi ng for it . Their biggest  probl em i s t hat 
t hey do not know w hat t hey are mi ssi ng. They rar el y
 
saw  t heir fat hers  succeed i n ful fil li ng 
t heir mot hers t hrough gi ving. As a result  t hey do not  know  t hat  a maj or source of ful fi lment  for 
a man can come t hrough givi ng. When hi s relat i onshi ps fail  he fi nds him sel f depress ed and 
st ucki n his c ave.H est ops 
cari ng and doesn't  know w hy he i s so depressed.
 
 
A t  such t imes  he wi t hdraw s fr om rel at i onshi ps or i nt imac y and remains st uck i n his cave. He 
asks hims el f w hat i t  i s al l  for, and w hy he should bot her. H e doesn't  know t hat  he has st opped 
car i ng because he do
esn't  feel  needed. H e does not  real i ze t hat  by fi nding someone w ho needs 
him , hecan shake off his depressi on and be moti vatedagain.
 
 
When a 
man doesn't  feel  he is making a posit i ve dif ference i n someone el se's li fe, it  i s hard for 
him  t o conti nue cari ng about hi s fife and rel ationshi ps. It is di ffi cul t to be moti vated w hen he 
i s not  needed. To become moti vat ed again he needs t o feel  appreci at e

N ott o be needed is a slow  deat h fora man.

A  w oman fal li ng i n l ove w it h a man i s si mi lar t o w hat  t ook place w hen t he fi rst  V enusi an

These Marti ans w ere very devoted and w ere i nspir ed by t he V

Marti ans recogni zed t hat  t heir pow er and competence w ere meani ngless  wi t hout  someone t o

O t her Venusians had si mi l ar dreams and i nst antl y came out  of their  depres si ons. The

To come out of depression t hey neededt o feel that l ovi ng hel p was on the way.

Most men have li tt l e aw areness of how import ant it  i s t o a w oman t o feel  supported by 
someone w ho cares . Women are happy w hen t hey beli e

w oman is  upset , overw hel med, confused, exhaust ed, or hopeless  w hat she needs most  i s s i mpl e

Em pat hy, underst andi ng, vali dat i on, an

more receptive and apprec i at i ve of hi s support. Men don't reali ze t his because t heir Mart i an

does not i nsti nct i vel y real i ze how  very i mportant cl oseness , i nt imac y, and shari ng are t o her. 
What s he needsmost  i sj ust someone t ol i st en.
 
 
Through shari ng her feel i ng

as she remem bers  t hat  she i s w ort hy of l ove
-
she doesn't  have t o earn it ; she can rel ax, give l ess,
 
and rec ei ve more. She deser ves it .
 
 
Endless Gi ving Is  Ti ri ng
 
 
To deal w it h their depress i on t he Venusi ans were busy shari ng t hei r feeli ngs and t al king about 
t heir problems. As t hey tal ked t hey di scovered the cause of t heir depressi on. They w ere ti red of

t hey sat i sfi ed beingmart yrs andl i vi ng for ot hers.
 
 
O n V enus, t hey l ived by l ose/wi n phi l osophy
-
"I l ose so t hat  you can wi n." A s l ong as everyone 
made sac ri fi ces for others , t hen everyone w as taken care of. But  aft er doi ng t hi s for c
ent uries 
t he V enusi ans w ere fired of al w ays cari ng about  one anot her and shari ng everythi ng. They al so 
w ereready for aw i n/w in phil osophy.
 
 
Sim il arl y, many w omen t oday are al so t i red of givi ng. They w ant time off. Time t o explore 
being t hemsel ves. Ti me t o
 
car e about  t hemsel ves fi rst . They want  
som eone to 
provi de 
emoti onal support, someone t hey don 't  'have t o t ake care of. The Mart ians fit  t he bi ll  perfect l y.
 
 
A t  t his  poi nt t he Marti ans w ere l earni ng t o give w hil e t he V enusi ans w ere now  ready t o l earn 
how  
t o rec ei ve. A ft er centuri es t he V enusi ans and Marti ans had reached an i mport ant  st age i n 
t heir  evol ut i on. The V enusi ans needed t o l earn how  t o recei ve w hi l e t he Mart ians needed to 
l earn how  t o give.
 
 
This  same change commonly t akes place i n men and w omen a
s t hey mat ure. In her younger 
years, a w oman is much more w i ll i ng t o sacr ifi ce and mould herself t o fulfi l her part ner's 
needs. In a man's younger years , he i s much more sel f
-
absorbed and unawar e of t he needs of 
others . A s a w oman matures she real i zes how  
she may have been givi ng up hersel f i n order to 
pleas e her part ner. As aman mat ures he reali zes how  he can bett erser ve and res pect  ot hers.
 
 
A s a man mat ures he al so l earns t hat he may be givi ng up hi ms el f, but  his  maj or change is 
becomi ng more aw are of h

G i vi ng U p Blame
 
 
When a w oman real i zes she has been gi ving t oo
 
much, she t ends t o blame her part ner for t heir 
unhappiness. She feel sthe inj ust ice of gi ving more t hanshe hasrec ei ved.
 
 
A lt hough she has not  recei ved w hat  she deserved, t o i mprove her relat i onshi ps she needs t o 
rec ognize how  she contri but ed t o t he prob
l em. When a w oman gives t oo much she shoul d not 
blam e her part ner. Simi l arl y, a man w ho gi ves l ess  shoul d not  blame his  part ner for being 
negat i ve or unrecepti vet o him. I n bot h cases, blami ng does notw ork.
 
 
U nderst andi ng, t rust , compassi on, acc ept ance, a
nd support  are t he soluti on, not  blami ng our 
part ners. When t his si t uat i on occurs , i nst ead of blami ng hi s femal e partner for bei ng res ent ful , 
a man can be compassionat e and offer hi s support  even if she doesn't ask for i t , l ist en t o her 
even i f at  fi rst  it
 
sounds l i ke blame, and hel p her t o t rust  and open up t o him  by doi ng li tt le

Inst ead of bl ami ng a man for giving l ess, a w oman can accept  and forgi ve her part ner's 
perfect i ons, especi al l y w hen he di sappoi nts her, trus
t  t hat  he w ants t o give more w hen he 
doesn't  offer  hi s support , and encourage him t o give more by appreci ati ng w hat  he does gi ve 
and conti nui ngt o askfor hi ssupport .
 
 
SETTING A N DR ESPECTIN G LI MITS
 
 
Most  import ant, how ever, a w oman needs t o recogni ze her 
boundari es of w hat she can gi ve 
w it hout resenti ng her part ner. Instead of expect i ng her part ner t o even t he sc ore, she needs to 
keep i t even by regul at ing how  much she gi ves.
 
 
Let 's l ook at  an example. Ji m w as t hirt y

ot hi ng l eft  t o give and w as 
ready t o l eave. H e convinced her t o come t o t herapy, but  she w as doubtf ul. In a si x
-
month 
peri od t hey w ere able to move t hrough t he t hree steps for heal i ng a rel ati onshi p. Today t hey 
are happil y marri edw ith threechil dren'.
 
 
St
ep 1: Mot i vat ion
 
 
I explai ned t o Jim t hat  his  wi fe was experi enci ng t w el ve years of acc umulat ed resentment . If  he 
w anted t o save t his marri age, he w oul d have t o do a l ot of l i st eni ng for her t o be mot i vat ed t o 
w ork on t heir marri age. For t he fi rst  si x sess
ions t oget her, I encouraged Susan t o share her 
feeli ngs and hel ped Jim pat i ent l y t o underst and her negati ve feel i ngs. This w as t he hardest 
part  of t hei r heal i ng process . A s he began t o real l y hear her pain and unful fil led needs, he 
became i ncreasi ngl y mot i
vat ed and confi dent  t hat  he coul d make t he changes necess ary t o have 
a l ovi ngrelat i onshi p.
 
 
Bef ore Susan could be mot ivated t o w ork on t hei r rel ati onshi p, she needed t o be heard and fel t 
t hat Jim val i dat ed her feel i ngs: t hi s w as t he first  st ep. A ft er Susa
n felt underst ood, t hey were 
able t o proceed t ot he next  step.
 
 
Step 2:R esponsi bil it y
 
 
 
 
36
 
 
The sec ond step w as t aki ng res ponsi bil it y. Ji m needed t o t ake res ponsi bi l it y for not  support i ng 
his  wi fe, w hil e Susan needed t o t ake responsi bi l it y for not  sett i ng boun
dari es. Jim apol ogi zed 
for t he ways he had hurt  her. Susan reali zed t hat  j ust  as he had stepped over her boundari es by 
t reat i ng her i n disr espect ful  w ays ( such as yelli ng, grumbl i ng, resi st i ng request s, and 
i nvali dati ng feel i ngs) , she had not  set  her bound
ari es. A lt hough she did not  need t o apol ogi ze, 
she did acknowl edge some r esponsi bi li t yfort hei r probl ems .
 
 
A s she graduall y acc epted t hat  her i nabi li t y t o set li mi t s and her tendency t o give more had 
contri but ed t o t hei r problem s, she w as able t o be more 
forgi vi ng. Taking res ponsi bi li t y for her 
probl em w as essenti al  t o rel easi ng her res entment . In t hi s w ay t hey bot h w ere mot ivated to 
l earn new w ays of s upport i ngeach ot hert hrough respect i ngl imit s.
 
 
Step 3: Practi ce
 
 
Ji m parti cularl y needed t o l earn how  t
o res pect  her boundari es, w hi l e Susan needed t o l earn 
how  t o set  t hem. Bot h of t hem needed t o l earn how  t o express honest  feel i ngs i n a res pect ful 
w ay. They agreed i n t hi s t hir d st ep to practi ce sett i ng and respect i ng l i mi ts, know i ng t hat  at 
t i mes t hey w ou
l d make mist akes. Bei ng abl e to make mi st akes gave them a safet y net w hile 
t hey bot h pract i ced. These ar esomeexampl es of w hatt heyl earned andpracti ced:
 
 
 
Susan practi ced sayi ng "I don't l i ke t he w ay you are t al king. Please st op yelli ng or I w ill 
l eave
 
t he room." Aft er l eaving the rooma few  times , she didn't  needt odo i t  anymore. 
 
 
When Jim w oul d make requests t hat  she w oul d lat er resent  doi ng, she prac ti ced sayi ng "N o, 
I need to rel ax" or "N o, I'm  t oo busyt oday." Shedis covered t hat  hew asmore at t
ent i vet o her 
because he underst oodhow  busy or ti red she was. 
 
 
Susan t ol d Ji m t hat  she w anted t o go on a vacati on, and w hen he sai d he w as t oo busy she 
sai dt hatshe w oul d go al one. Suddenly he shi fted hi s schedul eand wanted to go. 
 
 
When t hey t al ked and Ji m i nt errupted, she pract iced sayi ng "I'm not  fi nis hed, please hear 
me out." Suddenl y he start edl i st eni ng more and int err upti ng less . 
 
 
Susan's most  di ffi cul t  task w as t o pract i ce aski ng for w hat she w anted. She sai d t o me, 
"Why sho
uld I have t o ask, aft er all  I have done for him? " I explai ned t hat  maki ng him 
res ponsi ble for know i ng her wants  w as not  onl y unreal ist ic but  a big part  of her probl em. 
She needed to be res ponsi ble for get ti ng her needs fulfil l ed. 
 
 
Ji m's most  dif fi cul t  c
hall enge w as t o be res pectful  of her changes and not  expect  her t o be 
t he sam e acc ommodating part ner he ori gi nall y mar ri ed. He rec ognized t hat it  w as as 
dif fi cult  for her t o set  li mit s as i t  w as for him t o adjust  t o t hem. H e unders t ood t hat t hey 
w oul d beco
me grac eful as t hey had more pract ice.
 
 
A s a man experi ences  l i mi ts, he is mot i vat ed t o give more. Through res pect i ng l imit s, he 
automat icall y i s mot i vat ed t o questi on t he effect i veness  of his behaviour patt erns and t o st art 
maki ng changes. When a w oman re
al i zes t hat  in order t o rec ei ve she needs t o set s l imit s, t hen

Setti ng l imit s and receiving are very scar y for a w oman. She is commonly afr ai d of needi ng t oo

A  w oman i s part i cul arl y vul nerable t o t he negati ve and i ncorrect  beli ef t hat she

Bec ause she i s afrai d of not  being supported, she unknowi ngl y pushes aw ay t he support  she 
needs. When a man recei ves t he message t hat  she doesn't  t rust  hi m t o ful fil  he

she doesn't  t rust  him t o support  her. Ir onicall y, men
 
are pri maril y motivated by being needed, 
but  aret urned off  by neediness.
 
 
A t such ti mes, a w oman mist akenly ass umes that havi ng needs has turned him off w hen in

"N eeding" is openly reachi ng out  and aski ng for support  fr om a man i n a t rust i ng manner, one

For w omen, not onl y is needi ng ot hers confusi ng but  bei ng disappoi nt

O ne of t he big chal l enges for men is corr ectl y to i nter pret  and support a w oman w hen she is 
t al ki ng about her feel ings. The biggest  chal lenge for w omen i s correc tl y t o i nterpret  and 
support  amanw hen hei sn't t al king. Si l ence ismost easil ymi si nte
rpreted by women.
 
 
Q uit e oft en a man w il l suddenly st op communi cati ng and become sil ent. This w as unheard of 
on V enus. At  firs t  a woman t hinks t he man is deaf. She t hinks t hat maybe he doesn't  hear 
w hat's bei ng sai d and that  i s w hy he i s not  respondi ng.
 
 
Y
ou see men and w omen t hink and process  informat i on very differ entl y. Women t hi nk out 
l oud, shari ng t heir process  of i nner disc overy w it h an i nterest ed li st ener. Even t oday, a w oman 
oft en disc overs  w hat  she w ants t o say t hrough t he process  of j ust  t al king. 
This  process  of j ust 
l ett i ng t hought s fl ow freel y and expressi ng t hem out  l oud hel ps her t o t ap i nt o her i ntui ti on. 
This  process i s perf ect l y norm al  and especi al l y neces sary someti mes.
 
 
But  men process  i nformati on very di fferent l y. Bef ore t hey t al k or resp

"mul l  over" or t hi nk about  w hat  t hey have heard or experi enced. Internall y and si lentl y t hey 
fi gure out  t he most  correct  or useful  response. They fi rst  formul at e it  i nsi de and t hen express i t. 
This  proces s coul d t ake fr om mi nut es t
o hours. A nd t o make matt ers even more confusi ng for 
w omen, i f he does not  have enough i nform at i on t o process  an answ er, a man may not  respond 
at  all .
 
 
Women need t o understand t hat  w hen he i s silent, he i s sayi ng "I don't  know w hat  t o say yet, 
but  I am t h
i nki ng about  i t." Inst ead w hat  t hey hear i s "I am not  res pondi ng t o you because I 
don't car e about you and I am goi ng t o i gnore you. What  you have said t o me i s not import ant 
and t hereforeI am  not  responding."
 
 
N ow She R eacts t oH isSil ence
 
 
Women mi si nte
rpret  a man's si lence. Depending on how  she i s feeli ng t hat day she may begin 
t o imagi ne t he very worst
-
"H e hat es m e, he doesn't l ove me, he is  l eaving me forever." This  may 
t hen t rigger her deepest  fear, w hi ch i s "I am afr ai d t hat  i f he rejects me t hen I 
w il l never be 
l oved. I don't  deser vet o be loved."
 
 
When a man i s si l ent  it  i s easy for a w oman to i magi ne t he w ors t  because t he onl y t imes  a 
w oman w oul d be si l ent  are w hen w hat she had t o say w oul d be hurt ful  or w hen she di dn't 
w antt o tal k to a personbe
cause she di dn't t rust him  anymore and wanted to have not hingt o do

When a w oman l ist ens to anot her w oman, she w il l  cont i nue t o reassure t he speaker t hat she i s

Wi t hout  t hese reass uring res ponses, a man's si l ence can be very t hreat ening. Thr

Women have a l ot t o l earn about men before their  rel at i onshi ps can be real l y ful fi ll i ng. They 
need t o learn t hat  w hen a

This  l esson i s di ffi cul t for w omen because on V enus one of t he gol den rul e
s w as never to 
abandon a fr i end w hen she w as upset . It  j ust  doesn't  seem l ovi ng to abandon her favori te

Why MenG o Int o Their Caves
 
 
Men go int o thei rcaves
 
or become qui et  for a vari et y of reasons.
 
 
1. H e needs t ot hink about a probl emand fi ndapracti cal  sol uti on t ot heprobl em.
 
 
2. He doesn't have an answ er t o a quest i on or a problem. Men w ere never t aught t o say "G ee, I 
don't have an answ er. I need t o go i nto my cave and fi nd one." O t her men ass ume he i s doi ng 
j ust t hat w hen he becomes quiet .
 
 
3. H e has become upset or stres sed. 
At  such ti mes he needst o be al onet o cool off and fi nd his 
contr ol  agai n. He doesn't  w ant  t o do or say anything he mi ght regret .
 
 
4. He needs t o fi nd hi msel f. This fourt h reason becomes very import ant w hen men are i n l ove. 
A t t imes t hey begi n t o l ose and 
forget t hems elves. They can feel t hat  t oo much i nt imac y robs 
t hem of t heir pow er. They need t o regul at e how cl ose t hey get. Whenever t hey get  t oo cl ose so

Why Women Tal k
 
 
Women tal k for a vari ety of reas ons. Somet imes w omen tal k for t he same reas ons t hat  men st op 
t al ki ng. Theseare f our common reasonst hat  w omen t al k:
 
 
1. To convey or gat her info

2. To expl ore and di scover w hat it  i s she w ants t o say. (H e st ops t al king t o fi gure out  i nsi de

3. To feel  bett er and more c entered w henshe i su

4. To cr eat e i nti macy. Through shari ng her i nner feeli ngs she i s abl e t o know  her l ovi ng sel f. ( A

When a man w it hdraw s i nto his cave a w oman just  doesn't  underst and w hat i s happeni ng. She

A not her common comment by men i s "It  i s hard t o come out  of t he cave w hen I feel  
my mat e 
dis approves of t he t ime I spend i n t he cave." To make a man feel  w rong for goi ng i nt o his cave 
has t he eff ect  of pushi ng hi m back i nt o the cave even w hen he w ant st ocome out .

H owt o Support  a Man in His Cave
 
 
1. Don't  disapproveof hi s needforw it hdraw i ng.

2. Don't  try t o hel p hi msol ve hi s probl em by offer i ngsol ut i ons.
 
 
3. Don't  try t o nurt ure him by aski ng quest i ons about hi sfeel i ngs.
 
 
4. Don't  si t  next t o the door of t he caveand w ai t for him t ocome out .
 
 
5. Don't w orry about  him or f eel sorr yfor him.
 
 
6. Do somet hingt hatmakes you happy.
 
 
If  you need t o "t al k," wri t e hi m a l et t er t o be read l at er w hen he is out , and i f you need t o b
e 
nurt ured,t al k to afri end. Don't  make him t hesole s ource of your f ul fil lment .
 
 
A  man w ant s hi s favorit e V enusi an t o t rust t hat

t rust ed that  hecan handl e his problems i s very import ant  to hi s honor, pri de, and
 
self

est eem.
 
 
N ot w orr ying about  him i s di ffi cul t for her. Worryi ng for ot hers i s one way w omen express 
t heir  l ove and cari ng. It i s a w ay of showi ng l ove. For a w oman, being happy w hen t he pers on 
you l ove i s upset  j ust  doesn't seem ri ght . H e cert ai nl y do
esn't  w ant her t o be happy 
bec ause 
he 
i s upset, but  he does want her t o be happy. H e w ants  her t o be happy so t hat he has one l ess 
probl em t o w orr y about . In addit i on he w ant s her t o be happy because it  hel ps him t o feel 
l oved by her. When awoman is happy
 
and freefr omw orry, it  is easi erfor him t o come out .
 
 
Ir oni call y men show  t hei r l ove by not  w orryi ng. A  man questi ons "H ow  can you w orry about 
someone w hom you admi re and t rust ?" Men comm onl y support  one another by sayi ng phrases 
such as "Don't  w orry, y
ou can handl e it " or "That 's t heir probl em, not yours " or "I'm sure i t  w il l 
w ork out ." Men support one anot her by not w orryi ng ormi ni mi zi ng t hei r troubl es.
 
 
It  t ook me years t o unders t and t hat my wi fe actuall y w ant ed me t o w orry for her w hen she w as 
upset
. Wi t hout  t hi s aw areness  of our differ ent  needs, I woul d mi nimi ze t he importance of her 
concerns. This  onl y made her more upset .
 
 
When a man goes i nt o his  cave he is general l y trying t o sol ve a probl em. If  his  mat e i s happy or 
not  needy at t hi s t ime, then 
he has one l ess  problem t o sol ve before comi ng out . Know i ng t hat  
she i s happy wi t h hi mal so gives hi mmore st rengt h to deal w it h his probl emw hil ei n thecave.
 
 
A nyt hi ng t hat  dist ract s her or helps her t o feel good w i ll  be helpful  to him . These are some

When she sees I am i n my cave, she goes shopping. I never feel li ke I have t o apol ogi ze for my

She knows t hat  w hen I go i nt o my cave i s not t he ri ght  ti me t o t al k. When I begin showi ng

N OW TO  CO MMUN ICA TE SU PPO R T T

Even w hen t hey are out of t he cave men w ant  to be trust ed. They don't l i ke unsol i ci ted advi ce 
or empat hy. They need t o prove t hems el ves. Bei ng able t o acc ompli sh things w it hout t he hel p 
of others is a feat her in t heir cap. ( Whil e. for a w oman,
 
w hen someone ass ists her, havi ng a 
supporti ve rel at i onshi p i s a feat her i n her cap.) A  man feels support ed w hen a w oman 
comm uni cat esi n aw ayt hatsays, "It rust  you tohandle t hi ngs unl ess you di rect l yask for hel p."
 
 
Lear ni ng t o support men i n t his w ay 
can be very diffi cul t i n t he begi nning. Many w omen feel 
t hat t he onl y w ay t hey can get w hat  t hey need i n a rel at i onshi p is t o cr it i ci ze a man w hen he

t o give more by direct l y aski ng for support
-
wi t hout  being cri ti cal or offeri ng advi ce. In 
addi ti on, if he behaves i n a manner t hat she does not  l i ke she can simpl y and direct l y t el

t hatshe doesn't  li ke hi sbehavior,w it hout cast i ng judgment  t hat  hei sw rong or bad.
 
 
N owt oA pproach a Man Wit h Crit i ci sm orA dvi ce
 
 
Wi t hout  an underst anding of how  t hey are t urning men off  w it h unsol icit ed advi ce and 
cr it i ci sm, many w omen feel  pow
erl ess  t o get  what t hey need and w ant  fr om a man. N ancy w as 
fr ustrated i n her rel at ionshi ps. She sai d, "I st i ll  don't know  how  t o approach a man w it h 
cr it i ci sm and advi ce. What if his t abl e manners are at roci ous or he dresses  reall y, real l y badl y? 
What i f 
he's a ni ce guy but  you see he's got  a patt ern of behavi ng w ith people i n a w ay t hat

shoul d I do? N omat t erhow  It ell  him, he get s angry or defensi ve orj ust  i gno

The answ er i s t hat  she shoul d defi ni t el y not  off er cri ti cism or advi ce unl ess he asks. Inst ead, 
she shoul d t ry givi ng him l oving acc ept ance. This  i s w hat  he needs, not lect ures . As he begi ns 
t o feel  her accept ance, he w il l  begi n t o ask w hat she t
hi nks. If, how ever, he detect s her 
demandi ng t hat  he change, he w il l not ask for advi ce or suggest i ons. Especi al l y i n an i nti mat e 
rel at i onshi p,men needto feel  very secure before t hey open up andask for support .
 
 
In addi t ion t o pati ent l y tr ust i ng her par
t ner t o grow  and change, i f a w oman i s not  gett i ng w hat 
she needs and w ant s, she can and shoul d share her feeli ngs and make request s ( but  again 
w it hout givi ng advi ce or cr it i ci sm) . This  is an art  t hat  requires cari ng and cr eati vit y" These are 
four possi ble
 
approaches:
 
 
1. A w oman can t ell  a man t hat  she doesn't We the w ay he dres ses w it hout  givi ng hi m a l ect ure 
on how  t o dres s. She could say casuall y as he is gett i ng dress ed "I don't  li ke t hat  shi rt  on you. 
Woul d you wear anot her one t oni ght ?" If he is anno
yed by t hat comment , t hen she should 
res pect  his sensi ti vit i es and apol ogize. She could say "I' m sorry
-
I didn't  mean t o tell  you how  t o 
 
 
52
 
 
dress ."
 
 
2. If  he i s t hat  sensi ti ve
-
and some men are
-
t hen she could t ry tal ki ng about i t  at  anot her t ime. 
She could say 
"R emember t hat  bl ue shi rt  you w ore w i t h t he green sl acks? I didn't  l i ke t hat 
combi nat i on. Woul d you tr yw eari ng it w i t h your grey sl acks? "
 
 
3. She could di rectl y ask "Woul d you l et  me t ake you shoppi ng one day?I w oul d lovet o pick 
out  an outfit  for you." 
If he says no,t hen she canbe suret hat he doesn't w antany more 
mot heri ng. If he says yes, be sure not t o offer t oo much advi ce.R emem ber hi ssensi ti vit i es.
 
 
4. She couldsay "Thereis s omet hingI wantt o tal k about  but  I don't  know  how t o say it . 
[ Pause
.]  I don't w antt ooffend you, but  I al so real l yw ant t o say it . Would you l i st en andt hen 
suggest t ome a bet t er way I could sayi t ?" This hel ps hi mt o prepare himsel ffort he shock and 
t hen he happi l y di sc overs  t hat  it  is notsuch a big deal .
 
 
Let 's expl
ore anot her exampl e. If she doesn't  l i ke hi s t abl e manners and t hey are al one, she 
could say (w it hout a di sapprovi ng l ook)  "Woul d you use your si l verw are?" or "Woul d you 
dri nk fr om your glass ?" If , how ever, you are i n front of others , it  i s w ise t o say not
hi ng and not 
even noti ce. A not her day you coul d say "Woul d you use your si l verw are w hen w e eat i n front 
of t he kids? " or "When you eat  wi t h your fi ngers, I hat e it . I get  so pic ky about t hese l it tl e 
t hings.When you eat w it h me,w oul d you use your s il verw a
re?"
 
 
If  he behaves i n a w ay t hat embarr ass es you, w ait  for a t ime w hen no one el se is around and 
t hen share your feel i ngs. Don't ten hi m how he "shoul d behave" or t hat  he is w rong; i nst ead 
share honest  feel i ngs i n a l ovi ng and brief w ay. You could say "Th
e other night  at  t he part y, I 
didn't l i ke i t  w hen you w ere so l oud. When I' m around, w oul d you t ry t o keep it  dow n?" If he 
gets  upset  and doesn't  like this c omment , t hensimpl y apol ogi ze for bei ng crit ical .
 
 
This  art  of givi ng negat ive feedback and aski ng 
for support  is discussed t horoughly i n chapt ers 
9 and 12. In addi t i on, the best t imes for having t hese conversati ons i s expl ored i n t he next 
chapter.
 
 
When a Man Doesn't Need Hel p
 
 
A  man may st art  t o feel  sm ot hered w hen a woman tri es t o comf ort  him  or hel p
 
hi m sol ve a 
probl em. H e feel s as though she doesn't  t rust  him t o handl e hi s problems. H e may feel 
contr ol l ed,as if s hei st reat i ng hi ml i ke a chi l d,or he mayfeel  shew ants t o change him.
 
 
This  doesn't  mean t hat  a man does not  need comf ort i ng l ove. Wome
n need t o understand t hat 
t hey are nurt uri ng him w hen t hey abstai n fr om offeri ng unsol i ci ted advice t o sol ve his 
probl ems. He needs her l ovi ng support  but  i n a dif ferent  w ay t han she t hinks. To w it hhold 
corr ect i ng a man or tryi ng t o improve hi m are w ays t o
 
nurt ure him . G i ving advi ce can be 
nurt uri ng onl yi f he di rect l y asksfori t .
 
 
A  man l ooks for advi ce or help onl y aft er he has done w hat  he can do al one. If  he rec ei ves t oo 
much assi st ance or recei ves i t  t oo soon, he w il l  l ose hi s sense of pow er and stren
gth. He 
becomes ei t her l azy or insecure. Insti ncti vel y men support  one anot her by not  offer i ng advi ce 
or help unl ess speci fi call y approached and asked.
 
 
In coping wi t h problems, a man know s he has to fi rst  go a cert ai n di stance by hims el f, and t hen 
i f he n
eeds hel p he can ask for i t  wi t hout l osi ng his  st rengt h, pow er, and dignit y. To offer hel p 
 
 
53
 
 
t o a man at t hew rongt ime c oul d easi l y be t aken as an insult .
 
 
When a man i s carvi ng t he t urkey for Thanksgiving and his part ner keeps offeri ng advi ce on 
how  and w h
at  t o cut, he feel s mi st rust ed. H e resi st s her and is determi ned t o do i t  hi s w ay on 
his  own. O n t he ot her hand, i f a man offers her ass ist ance i n cut ti ng t he t urkey she feel s l oved 
and car edfor.
 
 
When a w oman suggest s t hat  her husband foll ow  t he advice o
f some expert , he may be 
offended. I remem ber one w oman aski ng me w hy her husband got so angry at  her. She 
explai ned t o me t hat before sex she had asked him  i f he had revi ew ed his  not es fr om a t aped 
l ect ure by me on t he secr ets of great  sex. She di dn't  rea
li ze t his  w as t he ulti mat e i nsult  t o hi m. 
A lt hough he had appreci at ed t he t apes, he didn't  w ant her t ell i ng him what t o do by rem i ndi ng 
him t o foll ow  my advi ce. H ew anted hert o tr ust t hat he knew w hat  t o do!
 
 
Whil e men want t o be trust ed, w omen w ant  cari n
g. When a man says to a w oman "What's t he 
matt er, honey?" w it h a concerned l ook on his face, she feels comfort ed by his  cari ng. When a 
w omani n a simil ar c aring and concernedw ay says t o a man "What 's t he mat ter, honey?" he may 
feel i nsult ed or r epul sed. H
e feel s ast hough she doesn't t rust  hi mt o handl e t hi ngs.
 
 
It  i s very di ffi cul t for a man t o di ffer ent i at e bet w een empat hy and sympat hy. H e hat es t o be 
pit ied. A  w oman may say "I am so sorr y I hurt  you." H e w il l say "It  w as no big deal " and push 
aw ay her s
upport. She on t he other hand l oves to hear him say "I'm sorry I hurt  you." She t hen 
feel s he real l y cares . Men need t o fi nd ways t o show  t hey car e w hil e w omen need t o fi nd w ays 
t o show  t heyt rust .
 
 
Too Much Cari ng Is Smotheri ng
 
 
When I fi rst  marr i ed Bonni

she w oul d ask me w hat t ime I w as gett i ng up. Then she w oul d ask what ti me my pl ane l eft . 
Then she w oul d do some ment al  fi guri ng and w arn me t hat  I hadn't  left  enough ti me t o cat ch

Each t ime she t hought she was support i ng me, but  I didn't  feel  i t. I felt  offended. I 
had been t raveli ng around t he w orl d for fourt een years t eachi ng courses , and I had never

Then i n t he morni ng, before I left , she asked me a stri ng of qu

your t i cket ? Do you have your w al l et ? Do you have enough money? Di d you pack socks? Do 
you know w here you are st aying?" She t hought  she was l ovi ng me, but I fel t  mistrust ed and 
w as annoyed. Eventually I l et her know  t hat  I app
rec i at ed her l ovi ng i nt enti on but t hat  I didn't 
l i ke bei ng mot hered inthis w ay.
 
 
I shared w it h her t hat if s he want ed t o mot her me, t hen t he w ay I w anted t o be mothered was to 
be uncondi ti onall y l oved and t rust ed. I sai d, "If  I miss  a plane, don't  t ell  me
 
'I t ol d you so.' 
Trust  t hat  I w il l  l earn my l ess on and adj ust  acc ordingl y. If  I forget  my t oot hbrush or shaving

i nst ead ofw hatshew oul d havew anted, it  w a

54
 
 
l aughed and sai d, "O h my goodness, John, you have such adventures. What are you goi ng t o

I asked her t o fax my passport  t o t he Sw edish consulat e, and t he problem w as sol ved. S
he w as

A  man commonly feels at t acked and blame

upset  and t al ks about probl ems. Bec ause he doesn't underst and how  w e are di ff erent , he 
doesn't readil y rel at e t oher need t o t al k about all  of her feel i ngs.
 
 
H e mi st akenl y ass umes she i s t el li ng him about  her
 
feel i ngs because she t hinks he is somehow  
res ponsi ble or t o be blamed. Bec ause she is upset  and she i s t al king t o him , he assumes she is 
upset  w i t h hi m. When she compl ai ns he hears  blame. Many men don't underst and t he 
( V enusi an)  needt o share upset feeli n

Wi t h pract i ce and an aw areness  of our di fferences, w omen can l earn how  t o express  t heir

In t his sam e vei n,

and t hat  w hen a 
w oman compl ai ns she is general l y j ust  l ett i ng go of her fr ustrati ons by t al ki ng about t hem. A 
w omancanw ork at  l et ting him  know  t hat t hough she is compl ai ni ng she al so appreci ates him.
 
 
For exampl e, my w ife just  came i n and asked how  I w as
 
doi ng on t hi s chapter. I sai d, "I'm 
al most  done.H ow  was your day?"
 
 
She sai d, "O h, t here i s so much t o do. We hardly have any t ime t ogether." The old me w ould 
have become defensi ve and t hen rem i nded her of al l  t he t ime w e have spent t oget her, or I 
w oul d 
have t old her how  import ant it  w as t o meet . my deadli ne. Thi s w oul d have j ust  creat ed

The new me, aw are of our diff erences, unders t ood she w as l ooking for reass urance and 
underst andi ng and not  just ifi cat i ons and expl anat i ons. I s ai d, "You'r erigh

She t hen sai d, "You feel  reall y good." This w as t he appreci at i on I needed i n order t o be more 
avail abl e t o her. She t hen proceeded t o compl ai n more about  h

She sai d, "R eal l y, you'll t ake t he babysit t er home?  That  w oul d be great . Thank you! " Again she 
gave 
me t he appreci at i on and acc eptance I needed t o feel  li ke a successful  part ner, even w hen 
she w as ti red and exhaust ed.
 
 
Women don't  t hink of givi ng appreci ati on because t hey assume a man knows how  much she 
apprec iat es being heard. H e doesn't  know . When she 
i s t al ki ng about  problems, he needs t o be 
reas sured t hat  hei s st il l l oved and apprec iat ed.
 
 
Men feel  fr ustrat ed by probl ems  unless  t hey are doi ng somet hing t o sol ve t hem. By 
apprec iati ng him, aw oman can hel p him reali ze t hatj ust  by li st ening he i s al so

A  w oman d

Four Magic Wo
rds of Support
 
 
The four magi c w ords to support  a man are "It 's not  your faul t ." When a w oman i s expres si ng 
her upset  feeli ngs s he can support  a man by pausi ng occasi onal l yt o encourage him by saying "I 
reall y appreci at e your li st eni ng, and if t his sounds 
as i f I'm  sayi ng it's your fault , t hat 's not 
w hatI m ean. It 's not  your fault ."
 
 
A  w oman can l earn t o be sensi ti ve t o her l ist ener w hen she unders tands his tendency t o start 
feeli ng li ke a fail urew hen he hears a l ot  of probl ems.

Just  t he other day my sis
t er call ed me andt al ked about  a diffi cul t  experi ence t hat  she w as going 
t hrough. A s I l i st ened I kept  rememberi ng t hat t o support  my si ster I didn't have t o give her 
any sol ut i ons. She needed someone j ust  to list en. A ft er t en mi nut es of j ust  l ist eni ng and
 
occasi onall y sayi ng t hings l i ke "uh
-
huh," "oh," and "ready!" she t hen sai d, "Well , t hank you, 
John. I f eel  so much better."
 
 
It  w as much easi er t o hear her because I knew  she was not  blami ng me. She was bl ami ng 
someone else. I fi nd i t more di ffi cul t w hen 
my wi fe i s unhappy because it  i s easi er for me t o 
feel  bl amed. H owever, w hen my wi fe encourages me t o l ist en by apprec i at i ng me, it  becomes 
much easi er t o bea good li st ener.
 
 
Whatt o Do When You Feel  Li ke Bl ami ng
 
 
R eassuri ng a man t hat  it  i s not  his  fault
 
or t hat he i s not  bei ng blamed w orks onl y as l ong as 
she trul y i s not blami ng him, di sapprovi ng of him , or cr it ici zi ng hi m. If  she i s at tacki ng him, 
t hen she shoul d share her feel i ngs wi t h someone el se. She shoul d w ai t  unt i l  she is more l ovi ng 
and centere
d t o tal k t o him . She coul d share her resent ful  feeli ngs w it h someone she is not 
upset  wi t h, w ho w il l  be able t o give her t he support  she needs. Then w hen she feels more 
l ovi ng and forgi vi ng she can success ful l y approach him t o share her feel i ngs. In chapt

N owt o Li st en Wi t hout Bl ami ng
 
 
A  man oft en bl ames a w oman for bei ng blami ng w hen she i s i nnocent l y t al king about 
probl ems. This i s very dest ructi ve tot he rel at i onshi p because 
i t  bl ockscommunicati on.
 
 
Im agi ne a w oman sayi ng "A l l  w e ever do is w ork, w ork, w ork. We don't have any fun anymore. 
You are s o seri ous." Aman coul d very easi l yfeel she i s blami ng hi m.
 
 
If  he feel s bl amed, Isuggest  he not  blame backand say "I f eel l i ke
 
youare bl ami ngme."
 
 
Inst ead I suggest  sayi ng "It  i s diff icult  t o hear you say I am so seri ous. A re you sayi ng it  i s al l 
my faul t t hatw e don't  have more fun?"
 
 
O r he coul d say "It  hurts w hen I hear you say I am so seri ous and w e don't have any fun.
 
A re 
you sayingt hati t i s al l my faul t ?"
 
 
In addi ti on, t o improvet he communicati on he can gi ve her a way out. He could say "It  feels l i ke 
you are sayi ng it  is all my fault  t hat  we w ork somuch. Is t hat  true?"
 
 
O r he coul d say "When you say w e don't  have 
any fun and t hat  I am so ser i ous, I feel  l i ke you

A ll  of t hese r esponses  are r espect ful  and give her a c hance t ot ake backany blam et hat he mi ght 
have felt . When she says "O h, no, I'm not  saying it 's al l  your faul

somew hatreli eved.
 
 
A not her approach t hat  I fi nd most  hel pful i s to rem ember t hat  she alw ays has a ri ght  t o be

The Art  ofLi st ening
 
 
A s a man l earns t o l ist en and i nterpret  a w oman's feel i ngs correct l y
, communicati on becomes 
easi er. A s wi t h any art , l i st ening requi res practice. Each day w hen I get home, I w il l general ly 
seek out Bonni eand ask her about her day,t huspracti ci ng t hi s art  ofl istening.
 
 
If  she is upset  or has had a st ress ful  day, at  firs t
 
I w il l  feel  t hat she is sayi ng I am somehow 
res ponsi ble and t hus to blam e. My great est  chal lenge i s t o not  t ake i t  personall y, t o not 
mi sunderst and her. I do t his by const ant l y remi ndi ng mysel f t hat  w e speak diff erent

el se happened?" I fi nd t hat  t here are many other t hi ngs 
bot heri ng her. Gradually I st art  t o see t hat  I am not sol el y res ponsi ble for her upset . A ft er a 
w hil e, w hen she begi ns t o appreci at e me for li st ening, t hen, even i f I was parti al l y responsi ble 
for he

A lt hough li st ening i s an i mport ant  ski ll  t o pract ice, some days a man i s too sensi t ive or stres sed 
t o t ranslat e t he i ntended meani ng of her phrases. At  such ti mes he shoul d not  even at t empt  t

Someti mes a m an doesn't  real i ze t hat  he can't  li st en unti l  she beginst al ki ng. If  he becomes very 
fr ustrated, w hil e l ist ening he shoul d not  t ry t o conti nue
-
he'll  j ust
 
become i ncreasi ngl y upset. 
That does not  serve him or her. Instead, t he respect ful  t hi ng t o say i s "I real l y want  t o hear w hat 
you are savi ng, but  ri ght now  i t  i s very diff icult  for me t o l ist en. I t hi nk I need some ti me to  
t hink about  w hat  you have just

A s Bonnie and I have l earned t o communic at e i n a way that res pect s our di ffer ences and 
underst and each other' s needs, our marri age has become so much easi er. I have w it nessed t hi s

Men Are
 
Li keR ubberBands
 
 
Men are l i ke rubber bands. When t hey pul l away, t hey can st ret ch onl y so far before t hey come 
spri ngi ng back. A rubber band i s t he perf ec
t  met aphor t o underst and the mal e i nti macy cycl e. 
This  cycl ei nvolves gett ing cl ose, pull i ng aw ay,and t hen get ti ng cl ose again.
 
 
Most w omen are surprised t o reali ze t hat even w hen a man l oves a w oman, peri odicall y he 
needs t o pul l  aw ay before he can get c
l oser. Men i nsti nct i vel y feel  t his urge t o pul l  aw ay. It  i s 
not  a deci si on or choi ce.It  j ust  happens. It  is neither his fault  nor her f aul t . It  is a nat ural  cycl e.
 
 
Women mi si nt erpret  a man's pull i ng aw ay because general l y a w oman pul l s aw ay for dif ferent
 
reas ons. She pull s back w hen she doesn't  trust him  t o underst and her feeli ngs, w hen she has 
been hurt  and i s afraid of being hurt  again, or w hen he has done somet hi ng w rong and 
dis appoint ed her.
 
 
Cert ai nl y a man may pul l  away for t he same reasons, but  he 
w il l  al so pull  away even i f she has 
done not hing w rong. He may l ove and t rust  her; and t hen suddenl y he begi ns t o pul l  aw ay. 
Li ke astret ched rubberband, he wi ll  dist ance hi ms el f and t hencome back all  on his own.
 
 
A  man pull s away t o ful fi ll  his  need for
 
i ndependence or autonomy. When he has fully 
st ret ched aw ay, t hen i nst antl y he w il l  come springi ng back. When he has full y separat ed, t hen 
suddenly he w il l feel  his  need for l ove and inti macy again. A ut omat i cal l y he wi l l he more 
mot ivated t o give hi s l ove 
and rec ei ve t he love he needs. When a man spri ngs back, he pic ks up 
t he rel at i onshi p at  w hatever degree of intimac y i t  w as w hen he stretched aw ay. He doesn't  feel  
any need fora peri od of getti ng reacquaint ed agai n.
 
 
WHA T EV ER Y WO MAN  SHOU LD KNO WA BO U TMEN
 
 
If  underst ood, t hi s mal e i ntimac y cycl e enriches a rel at i onshi p, but  because i t  i s mi sunders t ood 
i t  creates unnecess ary probl ems. Let 's explore an exampl e.
 
 
Maggi e w as di st ressed, anxious, and confused. She and her boyfr i end, Jef f, had been dat i ng for 
si x
 
mont hs. Ever yt hing had been so romanti c. Then w it hout any apparent  reason he began t o 
dis t ance hims el f emot i onall y. Maggi e coul d not  underst and w hy he had suddenly pull ed away. 
She t ol d me, "O ne mi nute he w as so att ent i ve, and t hen t he next he didn't  even
 
want t o t al k to 
me. I have t ri ed everyt hi ng t o get him back but  i t  onl y seems  t o make matt ers  w orse. H e seems 
so dist ant.I don't  knoww hatI di dw rong. Am I so awful ?"
 
 
When Jef f pul l ed aw ay, Maggi e t ook it  personal l y. This  i s a common react i on. She t hou
ght  she 
had done somet hi ng wrong and blam ed herself. She w anted t o make things "ri ght  again," but 
t he more s het ri ed to get cl oset o Jeff t he more he pul l edaw ay.
 
 
A fter t aki ng my semi nar Maggie w as so reli eved. H er anxi et y and confusi on immediat el y 
dis app
eared. Most  import ant, she st opped blami ng herself. She real ized t hat w hen Jeff  pull ed 
aw ay it  w as not  her fault . In addi ti on she l earned w hy he w as pul li ng aw ay and how  grac efull y 
t o deal  w it h i t . Mont hs l at er at  anot her semi nar, Jeff t hanked me for what 
Maggi e had l earned. 
H e t ol d me t hey were now  engaged t o be marr i ed. Maggie had discovered a secr et  t hat  few 
 
 
59
 
 
w omen know  about  men.
 
 
Maggi e reali zed t hat when she w as tryi ng t o get  cl ose w hile Jeff was t ryi ng t o pull  aw ay, she 
w as act ual l y preventi ng him  fr o
m stretchi ng his  full  dist ance and then spri ngi ng back. By 
runni ng aft er hi m, she w as prevent i ng him from ever feeli ng t hat  he needed her and w ant ed to 
be wi t h her. She reali zed t hat  she had done t hi s i n every rel at i onshi p. U nknow i ngl y she had 
obst ruct ed a
ni mport ant cycl e. Byt ryi ngt omai nt ai ni nti macy she had prevent edi t .
 
 
H owa ManIs  Suddenl y Transf ormed
 
 
If  a man does not  have t he opport uni t y t o pul l  aw ay, he never gets a chance t o feel  his strong 
desi re t o be cl ose. It is ess ent i al  for w omen to unde
rst and t hat i f t hey i nsi st  on cont i nuous 
i ntimac y or "run aft er" t heir i nt imate mal e part ner w hen he pul ls away, t hen he wi l l al most 
al w ays be t rying t o escape and di st ance hims el f; he wi ll  never get  a chance t o feel his ow n 
passi onat el ongingforlove.
 
 
I
n my semi nars I demonst rat e t his wi t h a big rubber band. Imagi ne t hat  you are hol ding a 
rubber band. N ow begin stretchi ng your rubber band by pull i ng it  t o your ri ght . This parti cul ar 
rubber band can stretch t w el ve i nches. When the rubber band i s stretched
 
t w el ve i nches t here 
i s now herel eft  t o go but back. And w heni t ret urns i t  has al ot of power and spri ng.
 
 
Li kew ise, w hen a man has stretched away his  ful l  di st ance, he w il l  ret urn wi t h a l ot of power 
and spri ng. O nce he pull s away t o his li mi t , he begi ns
 
t o go t hrough a transf orm at i on. Hi s 
w hol e att it ude begi ns to shi ft . Thi s man w ho di d not  seem t o care about or be i nt erest ed i n his 
part ner ( w hi l e he w as pull i ng aw ay)  suddenly cannot l i ve w it hout her. H e i s now  feeli ng again 
his  need for i nti macy. H i s po
w er is back because his desi re t o l ove and be l oved have been 
reaw akened.
 
 
This  i s general l y puzzli ng for a w oman because i n her experi ence if she has pul led away, 
becomi ng i nt imate again requires a peri od of re
-
acquai ntance. If  she doesn't underst and t hat
 
men are di ff erent  i n this  w ay, she may have a t endency t o mist rust  his  sudden desire for 
i ntimac yand push hi maw ay.
 
 
Men al so need t o unders t and t hi s di fference. When a man spri ngs back, before a w oman can 
open up again t o him  she generall y w ant s and nee
ds t ime and conversat i on t o reconnect . This 
t ransi ti on can be more gracef ul  if a man underst ands a w oman may need more ti me t o regain 
t he same l evel of i ntimac y
-
especi al l y i f she fel t hurt  w hen he pul led away. Wit hout t his 
underst andi ng of di ff erences, a m
an may become impati ent because he i s suddenl y avail abl e to 
pic k up the i nt imac y at w hateverl evel of i nt ensi t yi t w asw hen he pul l ed away andshe is not.
 
 
Why Men Pul l A way
 
 
Men begi n t o feel  t heir need for autonomy and i ndependence aft er they have ful fil
led t heir 
need for i nti macy. A utomati cal l y w hen he begins t o pul l  away, she begi ns t o pani c. What she 
doesn't  real i ze i s t hat  when he pull s aw ay and fulf il ls his need for aut onomy t hen suddenl y he 
w il l  w ant  t o be i nt i mate again. A  man aut omati call y al terna
t es betw een needi ng i nt imac y and 
autonomy.
 
 
For exampl e, i n t he beginni ng of hi s relati onship Jef f w as st rong and ful l  of desi re. Hi s rubber 
band w as full y st ret ched. H e w anted t o i mpress her, ful fi ll  her, pl ease her, and get  cl ose t o her. 
A s he succeeded 
she al so w anted t o get  cl oser . A s she opened her heart t o him  he got  cl oser and 
 
 
60
 
 
cl oser. When t hey achi eved i nt imac y he fel t w onderf ul. But  aft er a brief peri od a change t ook 
plac e.
 
 
Im agi ne w hat happens t o t he rubber band. The rubber band becomes li mp. It s
 
power and 
st ret ch are gone. There i s no l onger any movement . This i s exactl y what happens t o a man's 
desi re t o get  cl ose aft er inti macy has been achi eved.
 
 
Even t hough t hi s cl oseness i s ful fi ll i ng t o a man, he wi ll  i nevi t abl y begi n t o go t hrough an 
i nner 
shift . H e w i ll  begin t o feel  t he urge t o pul l aw ay. H aving temporari l y fulfil l ed his hunger 
for i nt imac y, he now  feel s hi s hunger t o be independent , t o be on his  ow n. Enough of t his 
needi ng anot her person. H e may feel  he has become t oo dependent  or may not
 
know w hy he 
feel s a needt o pull  aw ay.
 
 
Why Women Pani c
 
 
A s Jef f i nst i ncti vely pul l s aw ay wi t hout  any explanati on t o Maggie (or t o hi mself) , Maggie 
reac ts wi t h fear. She panic s and runs aft er hi m. She t hinks she has done somet hing w rong and 
has t urned hi m
 
off. She i magines he i s expect ing her t o re
-
est abl ish i nt i macy. She is afr ai d he 
w il l  never c ome back.
 
 
To make matt ers w orse,she feels powerl ess t o get  him  back because she doesn't  know w hat  she 
did t o t urn him off. She doesn't  know  t hat  t his i s j ust  a 
part  of his i nt i macy cycl e. When she 
asks hi m w hat 's t he matt er, he doesn't have a cl ear answ er, and so he resi sts tal ki ng about  i t . H e 
j ust conti nuest o dist ance her evenmore.
 
 
Why Men andWomenDoubt Thei rLove
 
 
Wi t hout  an understanding of t his  cycl e i t
 
i s easy t o see how  men and w omen begi n t o doubt 
t heir l ove. Wi t hout  seeing how  she w as preventi ng Jeff  fr om fi ndi ng his passi on, Maggi e coul d 
easil y assume t hat  Jeff  didn't l ove her. Wi t hout getti ng t he chance t o pull  aw ay, Jeff w oul d l ose 
t ouch wi t h hi s 
desi re and passi on t o be cl ose. H e could easil y assume t hat he no l onger l oved 
Maggi e.
 
 
A fter l earni ng t o l et  Jeff have hi s dist ance or "space," Maggi e discovered t hat  he did come back. 
She practi ced not  running aft er him w hen he woul d wi t hdraw  and t rust ed
 
t hat  everyt hi ng w as 
O K.Eac ht ime he di d come back.
 
 
A s her t rust  i n t hi s proces s grew , i t  became easi er for her not  t o panic. When he pull ed aw ay 
she did not  run aft er him or even t hink something w as w rong. She accept ed t hi s part  of Jef f. 
The more she j u
st  accepted him  at  t hose t imes t he sooner he w oul d ret urn. A s Jeff  began to 
underst and his changi ng feeli ngs and needs, he became more confi dent i n hi s l ove. H e w as 
able t o make a commi tment . The secr et  of Maggi e and Jeff s succ ess  w as t hat t hey underst ood 
and acc ept ed that men are li ke rubber bands.
 
 
H OW WO MEN  MISINTER PRET MEN
 
 
Wi t hout  an underst andi ng of how  men are l ike rubber bands, i t  Is very easy for w omen to 
mi si nterpret  a man's react i ons. A  comm on confusi on ari ses w hen she says "Let 's t al k" and 
i mmed
i at el y he emot i onall y di stances hi mself.R i ght  w henshew ants to open up and get cl oser, 
he w ant s t o pul l aw ay. Commonl y I hear t he compl ai nt "Every ti me I want t o t al k, he pul ls 
aw ay. I feel  l i ke he doesn't car e about  me." She mist akenly concl udes that he
 
doesn't 
ever 
w ant 
 
 
61
 
 
t o tal k to her.
 
 
This  rubber band analogy explai ns how  a man may car e very much about hi s part ner but 
suddenly pul l  aw ay. When he pul ls aw ay it  is not  because he does not w ant t o t al k. Instead, he 
needs some t ime al one; t i me t o be wit h h
ims el f w hen he is  not  responsible for anyone el se. It  is 
a t ime f or him t ot ake care of hims el f.When heret urnst hen hei s avail abl e t ot al k.
 
 
To a cert ai n ext ent a man 
l oses  
hi mself t hrough connect i ng wi t h hi s part ner. By feel i ng her 
needs, probl ems, w ant s, and emoti ons he may l ose t ouch wi t h hi s own sense of self. Pull i ng 
aw ay al l ow s hi m t o re
-
est abl i sh hi s pers onal boundari es and fulf il l  hi s need t o feet 
autonomous.
 
 
Some me
n, how ever, may descri be t hi s pull i ng aw ay diff erentl y. To t hem i t i s j ust a feeli ng of 
"I need some space" or "I need t o be al one." R egardl ess of how  i t is descri bed, w hen a man pull s 
aw ay, hei sful fi ll i nga val i d need tot ake care ofhim sel ffor aw hil e
.
 
 
Just  as w e do not  
dec i de 
t o be hungry, a man does not  deci de t o pul l  aw ay. It  i s an i nsti nct ual 
urge. Hecan onl y get  socl ose, andt hen he begi ns t o lose hims el f.A t  t hi s poi nt he begi ns t ofeel 
his  need for autonomy and begi ns t o pul l  away. By underst
andi ng this  process , w omen can  
begi n correct l yt o int erpret t his  pul li ng aw ay.
 
 
Why Men Pul l A way When WomenG et  Cl ose
 
 
For many w omen, a man t ends t o pull  aw ay preci sel y at  t he t ime w hen she w ants t o t al k and be 
i ntimat e. This occ urs  for t w oreas ons.
 
 
1. 
A w oman wi l l unconsc i ousl y sense w hen a man i s pul li ng aw ay and preci sel y at  t hose t imes 
she wi ll  att empt  t ore
-
est abli sh t hei ri nti mat e connect i onand say "Let 'stal k." A s he conti nuest o 
pul l  aw ay, she mi stakenl y concl udest hat he doesn't w antt o tal k or
 
t hat he doesn'tcar e for her.
 
 
2. When a w oman opens up and shares  deeper and more i nt imate feel i ngs it  may act uall y 
t ri gger a man's need t o pul l  aw ay. A  man can only handle so much i nti mac y before his  al arm 
bell s go off, sayi ng i t is t i me t o fi nd balance
 
by pul l i ng aw ay. At  t he most  i nti mat e moments a 
man maysuddenly automati cal l y swi t cht o feeling his  needfor aut onomy and pull  aw ay.
 
 
It  i s very confusi ng for a w oman w hen a man pul l s aw ay because somet hi ng she says or does 
oft en t ri ggers hi s depart ure. 
G enerall y w hen a w oman st art s t o t al k about  t hi ng wi t h 
f eeli ng 
a 
man st arts t o feel  t hi s urge t o pul l  aw ay. Thi s is because feel i ngs draw men cl oser and creat e 
i ntimac y, and w hen a man get st oo dose he automati cal l y pul l saw ay.
 
 
It  i s not  t hat  he doesn't  w
ant t o hear her feeli ngs. At  anot her ti me i n hi s i nti mac y cycl e, w hen 
he i s needi ng t o get cl ose, t he same 
fee li ngs 
t hat  could have t ri ggered his  depart ure w il l  draw 
him  cl oser. It  i s not w hat  she says t hat t riggers  hi s depart ure but  
w hen 
she saysi t .
 
 
WH E
N  TO  TALK WITH  A MA N
 
 
When a man is pul li ng aw ay i s not t he ti me t o tal k or try t o get cl oser . Let  hi m pull  aw ay. Aft er 
some ti me, he w il l  ret urn. H e wi ll  appear l ovi ng and supporti ve and wi l l  act  as t hough not hi ng 
has happened. Thi s is 
the 
t imet o tal k.
 
 
A t  t his gol den ti me, when a man w ant s i ntimac y and i s act uall y avail abl e t o t al k, w omen 
 
 
62
 
 
generall y don't  i ni ti at econversat i ons. Thi s occ urs f ort heset hree common reasons:

N OW TO G ETA  MAN
 
TO  TALK
 
 
When a w oman w ant s to t al k or feel s t he need t o get cl ose, she shoul d do t he t al ki ng and not 
expect a man t o i nit i at e t he convers at i on. To i nit i at e a convers ati on she needs to be t he firs t to 
begi n shari ng, even i f her part ner has l it tl e t o say. 
A s she appreci at es him  for l i st ening, 
graduall y hew il l  havemoret o say.
 
 
A  man can be very open t o havi ng a convers ati on wi t h a w oman but  at fi rst  have not hing t o say. 
What w omen don't know  about Marti ans is t hat  t hey need t o have a reason t o t al k. They 
don't 
t al k j ust  for t he sake of shari ng. But  w hen a w oman t al ks for a w hi l e, a man wi ll  st art  t o open 
up and share how  herelat est o what  she hasshared.
 
 
For example, i f s he tal ks about s ome of her diff icul ti es duri ng t he day he may share s ome of t he 
dif f
i cult i es of hi s day so t hat  t hey can unders tand each other. If  she tal ks about her feel i ngs 
about t he kids, he may t hen t al k about his feel i ngs about  t he kids. As she opens up and he 
doesn't feel  bl amed or pres sured, then he gradual l y begi nst o open up.
 
 
H
owWomen PressureMen to Tal k
 
 
A  w oman shari ng her thoughts  nat ural l y mot i vat es a man t o t al k. But  w hen he feel s a demand 
i s being made t hat  he t al k, his mi nd goes bl ank. H e has not hi ng t o say. Even i f he has 
somet hi ngt o say hewi ll res ist  because he feel
sher demand.
 
 
It  i s hard for a man w hen a w oman demands that 
he 
t al k. She unknowi ngl y t urns hi m off by 
i nterrogati ng him. Especi al l y w hen he doesn't  feel  t he need t o t al k. A  w oman mi st akenl y 
ass umes t hat a man "needs t o tal k" and t heref ore "shoul d." She f
orgets that he is from Mars  and 
doesn't feel t he need t otal k asmuch.
 
 
She even feel s t hat unless  
he 
t al ks, he doesn't l ove hen To reject a man for not t al king is to 
ensure t hat he has not hing t o say. A  man needs t o feel  acc ept ed j ust  t he w ay he i s, and t
hen he 
w il l  gradual l y open up. H e does not  feel  acc epted w hen she w ant s him t o t al k more or res ent s 
him  for pull i ngaw ay.
 
 
 
63
 
 
 
A  man w ho needs t o pul l  aw ay a l ot befor
e he can l earn t o share and open up w i ll  first  need to 
l i st en al ot.H e needs t obe appreci at ed forl ist eni ng, t hen gradual l y hewi l l saymore.
 
 
H owt o Ini ti at e a Convers ati on wi t h a Man
 
 
The more a w oman tri es t o get  a mant o tal k themore he wi ll  resi st .
 
Di rect l yt ryi ngt o get  hi m t o 
t al k is not  t he best  approach, especi al l y if he i s st ret chi ng aw ay. Inst ead of w onderi ng how  she 
can get hi m t o t al k a bett er quest i on mi ght be "H ow  can I achieve great er i nt imac y, 
convers at i on,and communi cati onw it h my part
ner?
 
 
If  a w oman feel s t he need for more t al k i n t he rel at i onshi p, and most w omen do, t hen she can  
i niti at e more convers at ion but  w i t h a mat ure aw areness  t hat  not  onl y acc epts but  also expects 
t hatsomet imes  hewi l lbe avail ableand at  ot her t imes  he wi ll  
i nst incti vel y pull  aw ay.
 
 
When he is avail abl e, inst ead of aski ng him tw enty questi ons or demanding t hat he t al k, she 
could l et  him  know  t hat she apprec iat es hi m even if  he just l i st ens.In t he begi nni ng she shoul d 
even discourage hi mfr om t al king.
 
 
For ex
ampl e, Maggi e could say "Jeff, w oul d you l ist en t o me for a w hil e? I' ve had a hard day 
and I w ant t o t al k about i t . It  w il l  make me feel  much bett er." Aft er Maggie t al ked for a couple 
of mi nutes t hen she coul d pause and say "I real ly appreci at e w hen you li
st en t o my feeli ngs, it 
means al ott ome." This apprec iati on encourages a mant o li sten more.
 
 
Wi t hout  appreciati on and encouragement , a man may l ose i nterest  because he feel s as t hough 
his  "l ist eni ng" i s "doi ng not hing." H e doesn't  real i ze how  val uabl e h
is li st eni ng is t o her. Most 
w omen, how ever, i nsti nct i vel y know how  i mport ant l i st ening i s. To expect  a man t o know t his 
w it hout some trai ni ng is t o expect  him t o be li ke a w oman. Fort unat el y, aft er bei ng appreci at ed 
for li steningt o aw oman, a man does l e
arn t orespect t he val ue oft al king.

When a man get s t oo close and doesn't pull  away, common symptoms are i ncr eased moodi ness,

O BSTRU CTIN G TH E 
IN TIMA CY CYCLE
 
 
There are tw o w ays a w oman may unknowi ngly obst ruct  her mal e part ner's nat ural  i nti macy 
cycl e. They are:( 1) chasing 
him w hen he 
pull s aw ay; and( 2)  puni shi nghim  for pull i ngaw ay.
 
 
The fol l ow i ng is a l ist  of t he most  common ways a w oman "c
hases  a man" and prevent s hi m 
fr om pul li ng aw ay:
 
 
 
CH A SING  BEHAV IO RS
 
 
1. Physi cal
 
 
When he pul l s aw ay, she physicall y fol l ow s him . H e may w al k i nto anot her room and
 
she 
fol l ow s. Or as i n the exampl e of L isa and Ji m, she does not  do t he t hings she w ants t o do so t hat 
she can bew it h her partner.
 
 
2. Em ot i onal
 
 
When he pul l s aw ay, she emot i onal l y foll ows him . She w orri es about him . She w ants t o help 
him  feel  bet ter. Sh
efeels s orryfor hi m. She sm ot hers hi mwi t h at t ent i on and praise.
 
 
A not her w ay she may emot i onall y st op hi m fr om pull i ng aw ay i s t o disapprove of hi s need to 
be alone. Through disapprovi ng she i sal soemoti onall y pull i ng hi m back.
 
 
A not her approach i s t o 
l ook l ongingl y or hurt  w hen he pull s aw ay. In t his w ay she pleads for 
his  i nt imac yand he feels c ontrol led.
 
 
3. Mental
 
 
 
67
 
 
 
She may t ry t o pull  him back ment all y by asking him  guil t
-
i nduci ng quest i ons such as "How 
could you treat me t his  w ay?" or "What 's w rong
 
w it h you?" or "Don't  you reali ze how  much it 
hurt smew hen you pull aw ay?"
 
 
A not her way she may t ry t o pul l  hi m back i s t o t ry t o please him. She becomes  overly 
acc ommodati ng. She t ries t o be perfect  so he w oul d never have any reason t o pull  aw ay. She 
giv
es up her s ense ofself and tri est o becomewhat s het hinks he wants.
 
 
She i s afr ai d t o rock t he boat  for fear  t hat  he mi ght pull  aw ay, and so she w it hholds her t rue 
feeli ngs and avoi ds doing anyt hingt hat  may upset  hi m.
 
 
The sec ond maj or w ay a w oman may u
nknow i ngl y i nt err upt  a man's i nti macy cycl e is to 
punis h him for pul l i ng aw ay. The fol l ow i ng i s a li st of t he most  common w ays a w oman 
"punis hes aman" and prevent s hi mfr om comi ng back and openi ng up t o her:
 
 
PU NISHING  BEH AV IO R S
 
1. Physi cal
 
 
When he begins t o desi re her agai n she rej ects him. She pushes away his  physical affecti on. 
She may rej ect  him  sexuall y She doesn't  al l ow  him  t o t ouch her or be dose. She may hi t  him or 
break thi ngsi n order t oshow her di spl easure.
 
 
When a man i s punis hed
 
for pul li ng aw ay, he can become afr ai d of ever doi ng it  agai n. This 
fear  may prevent  him from pull i ng away i n t he fut ure. Hi s nat ural  cycl e i s t hen broken. It may 
al so creat e an anger t hat blocks hi m fr om feel i ng his  desi re for i nti macy H e may not come ba
ck 
w hen he has pull ed aw ay.
 
 
2. Em ot i onal
 
 
When he ret urns, she is unhappy and she blames him. She does not  forgive him for negl ect i ng 
her. There i s not hing he can do t o pl ease her ormake her happy.H e feel s i ncapabl e offul fi ll i ng 
her and gives up.
 
 
When
 
he ret urns, she express es her disapproval  t hrough w ords, t one of voi ce, and by l ooki ng at 
her part neri n a cert ai nw oundedw ay.
 
 
3. Mental
 
 
When he ret urns, she refuses t o open up andshare herfeeli ngs. She becomes c ol d andres ent s 
him  for not opening up
 
and t al ki ng.
 
 
She st ops t rust i ng t hat he reall y cares and puni shes hi m by not  gi ving him  a chance t o l i st en 
and be the "good" guy.When he happil y ret urns t o her, he is i nt he doghouse.
 
 
When a man feel s punished for pull i ng aw ay, he can become afr ai d of 
l osi ng her l ove if he 
pul l s aw ay. H e begins to feel  unw ort hy of her love i f he pul ls aw ay. He may become afr ai d to 
reac h out  for her l ove again because he feel s unwort hy; he ass umes he wi l l be rej ect ed. This 
fear  ofrejecti on prevents hi mfr om c omi ng back 
fr om hi sj ourneyi ntothe cave.
 
 
H OW A MAN 'S PA STMA YA FFECT HIS IN TIMA CY CYCLE
 
 
 
68
 
 
 
This  natural  cycl e i n a man may al ready be obst ruct ed from hi s chil dhood. H e may be afr ai d to 
pul l  aw ay because he wi t nessed his mot her's disapproval  of hi s fat her's emot i onal
 
dist anci ng. 
Such a man may not  even know t hat  he needs t o pul l  aw ay. H e may unconsci ousl y create 
argument st o just ify pull i ng aw ay.
 
 
This  kind of man natural l y devel ops more of his  femi nine si de but  at  t he expense of 
suppres si ng some of his mas cul i ne pow e
r. H e is a sensi ti ve man. He t ri es hard to please and be 
l ovi ng but  l oses  part  of his  masc ul i ne self i n t he process. H e feel s guil ty pul li ng aw ay. Wi t hout 
knowi ng w hat has happened he l oses his  desire, pow er, and passi on; he becomes pass ive or 
overl y depen
dent.
 
 
H e may be afr ai d t o be al one or t o go i nto his cave. H e may t hink he doesn't  li ke bei ng al one 
because deep i nsi de he i s afrai d of l osi ng l ove. H e has al ready experienced i n chi l dhood his 
mot her rej ecti ng hi s f ather or direct l yrej ecti nghim .
 
 
Whil e some men don't  know how  t o pull  aw ay, others don't  know  how t o get  cl ose. The mac ho 
man has no problem pul l i ng aw ay. H e j ust  can't  come back and open up. Deep i nsi de he may 
be afr ai d he is unw ort hy of l ove. H e is afrai d of being close and cari ng a l o
t . H e does not  have a 
pic t ure of how  w elcomed he w oul d be i f he got  cl oser. Bot h t he sensi tive mal e and t he mac ho 
mal earemi ssi ng a positi ve pict ure or experi ence of t hei r nat ural  i nt imacy cycl e.
 
 
U nderst andi ng t his male i ntimac y cycl e i s j ust  as i mport an
t  for men as i t  i s for w omen. Some 
men feel  gui lt y needi ng t o spend t ime i n t heir caves or t hey may get confused w hen t hey st art  
t o pull  aw ay and t hen lat er spri ng back. They may mi st akenl y t hink somet hi ng i s w rong, w ith

When he ret urns t o tal k, she mi ght  probe him t o underst and w hy he l eft. If  he's not  sure, w hich

If  she has suppress ed any negat i ve feel i ngs or deni ed herself i n order t o be more l ovi ng on t he

My w ife, Bonni e, says t his  experience of "going dow n" i s li ke goi ng dow n i nto a dark w el l. 
When a w omen goes i nt o her "wel l " she is consc i ousl y si nki ng i nto her unconsc i ous sel f, i nto 
darkn
ess  and diffused feeli ng. She may suddenly experi ence a host  of unexplai ned emoti ons 
and vague feel i ngs. She may feel  hopeless , t hi nking she i s all  al one or unsupport ed. But  soon 
aft er she reaches t he bot t om, if she feel s l oved and support ed, she wi ll  auto

A  w oman's abil it y t o give and rec ei ve l ove i n her rel at i onshi ps is general l y a refl ect i on of how

or more emot i onal l y react i ve. When her w ave hit s bot t om she is more vul nerable 
and needs 
more l ove. It  i s cr uci al that her part ner underst and w hat  she needs at  t hese ti mes, ot herw i se he 
may make unreasonabl e demands.

When a man l oves a woman she begi ns t o shine wi t h l ove and ful fil lment . Most  men naively

A  man assumes t hat  her sudden change of mood i s based
 
sol el y on his behavior. When she is 
happy he t akes cr edi t, but  w hen she i s unhappy he al so feel s responsi ble. H e may feel

Don't  Try t o Fi x It
 
 
Bi ll  and Mary had been marr ied for si x years . Bi l l had observed t his w ave patt ern i n Mary, but 
because he di dn't underst and i t , h
e t ri ed t o "fix i t ," w hich j ust made mat t ers w orse. H e t hought 
somet hi ng w as wrong w it h her t endency t o go up and dow n. H e w ould try expl ai ni ng t o her 
t hatshe didn't  needt o be upset .Mary onl y fel t moremi sunderst ood and thus more distres sed.
 
 
A lt hough h
e t hought  he w as "fi xi ng it ," he was act uall y prevent i ng her from feel i ng bett er. 
When a w oman moves i nto her w ell , he needs t o l earn t hat  t his i s when she needs hi m the 
most , and i t i s not a probl em t o be sol ved or fi xed, but  an opport unit y t o support  her
 
w it h 
uncondi ti onal l ove.
 
 
Bi ll  sai d, "I can't underst and myw ife, Mary. For w eeksshe is t he most w onderful w oman. She 
gives her l ove so uncondit i onall y tome andt o everyone. Then suddenl y she becomes  
overw hel med by how much she is doingfor everyone and
 
st art s bei ng di sapprovi ng ofme.It 's 
not  my fault  she's unhappy. I explai nt hatt o her, and we j ust  get  i nt o the biggest  fi ghts."
 
 
Li ke many men, Bil l  made t he mi st ake of t rying t o prevent  his  part ner fr om "goi ng dow n" or 
"bot t omi ng out ." H e t ried t o res
cue her by pull i ng her up. H e had not  l earned t hat w hen his 
w i fe w as going dow nshe needed to hi t  bot t om before s he could come up.
 
 
When his w ife, Mary, st arted t o cras h, her first sympt om was t o feel overw hel med. Inst ead of 
l i st ening to her w it h cari ng, w
armt h, and empat hy, he w oul d try t o bri ng her back up w it h 
explanat i ons ofw hy she shoul dn't  be so upset .
 
 
The l ast  t hi ng a w oman needs w hen she is on her w ay dow n i s someone t el li ng her w hy she 
shoul dn't  be dow n. What  she needs i s someone t o be w it h her a
s she goes dow n, t o list en to her 
w hil e she shares her feel i ngs, and t o empat hi ze w it h w hat  she i s goi ng through. Even i f a man 
can't full y underst and w hy a w oman feel s overw hel med, he can off er his l ove, at t ent i on, and 
support .
 
 
N owMenA re Confused
 
 
A fte
r l earni ng how w omen are l i ke w aves, Bil l  w as st il l confused. The next ti me hi s w ife 
seem ed t o be i n her w ell , he pract iced l i st eni ng t o her. A s she t al ked about  some of t he t hings 
t hat w ere bot heri ng her, he pract i ced not  offeri ng suggest i ons t o "fi x her"
 
or make her feel 
bett er. Aft er about tw ent y mi nut es he became very upset , because s hew asn't  feel i ng any bett er.
 
 
H e t ol d me, "A t  fi rst  I l ist ened, and she seemed t o open up and share more. But  t hen she st art ed 
getti ng even more upset . It  seemed t he more 
I l i st ened t he more upset she got . I t old her she 
shoul dn't be gett i ng more upset  and t hen w egot  i nto a bi gargument."
 
 
A lt hough Bil l  was li st ening t o Mary, he w as stil l  t ryi ng t o fix her. H e expect ed her to feel  bet t er 
ri ght away. What  Bil l didn't know i
s t hat  when a w oman goes i nto her w ell , i f she feels 
support ed she doesn't  neces saril y feel  bett er ri ght aw ay. She may feel  w orse. But  t hat i s a si gn 
t hat his support  may be helpi ng. H is support may act ual l y help her to hit bott om sooner, and 
t hen she can 
and w il l  feel  better. To genuinel y come up she fi rst  needs t o hit  bot t om. That is 
t he cycl e.
 
 
Bi ll  w as confused, because as he l i st ened t o her she appeared t o get  no benefit  from his 
support . To him  she j ust  seemed t o be goi ng deeper. To avoi d t his confusi
on a man needs to  
 
 
72
 
 
rem ember t hat someti mes w hen he i s succeeding i n supporti ng a w oman she may become even 
more upset . Through underst andi ng t hat  a w ave must  hi t  bot t om before i t  can rise agai n he can 
rel ease his expect at i onst hatshe imm edi atel yfeel  bett e
ri n responset ohis  assi st ance.
 
 
Wi t h t hi s new  i nsi ght , Bi ll  w as able t o be more underst andi ng and pat i ent  w it h Mary. A ft er 
becomi ng much more successful i n support i ng Mary i n her well , he al so l earned t hat  t here w as 
no w ay t o predi ct  how long she w oul d b

TH R EE STEPS FOR  SUPPOR TING  HER 
 
WH EN H EN EEDS TO PU LL AWA Y
 
 
1. A ccept  Your Li mi t at i ons
 
The fi rst t hing you need t o do is ac ceptt hat youneed t o pull  aw ay and have nothi ng t o gi ve.N o 
matt er how  l ovi ng youw antt o be, 
youcannot li st en att enti vely. Don't try t o li st enw hen you 
can't .
 
 
2. U nders t and H er Pai n
 
N ext, you needt o underst andt hatshe needs more t han youcan give at this  moment. H er pai n 
i s val i d. Don't  make her w rongfor needi ng more or for  bei ng hurt . It  hur
t st o be abandoned 
w hen she needs your l ove. You are not  wrong for needi ngspace,and she is  not  wrong for 
w anti ng t o be close. You may be afr ai d that  shew il l  not  forgi ve you or trust . She can bemore 
t rust i ng andforgi vingi f you are cari ngand unders t an
di ng of her hurt .
 
 
3. A voi d Arguingand Gi ve Reass urance
 
By underst andi ng her hurt  youw on't make herw rong for bei ng upset  and i n pai n.Al t hough 
you can't gi vet he support  shew ant s and needs,you can avoidmaki ng it w orse by argui ng. 
R eassure her t hat  yo
uwi l l  be back,and t hen you wil l  beablet o give her t he support she 
deserves.
 
 
WhatH e Can SayInstead of Arguing
 
 
There w as not hi ng wrong w i t h H arri s's need to be al one or w at ch TV, nor w as t hei r anyt hi ng  
w rong w it h Cat hy's hurt  feel i ngs. Inst ead of arg
uing for his ri ght  t o wat ch TV , he could have 
t old her somet hi ng li ke t his : "I underst and you'r e upset , and ri ght  now I real l y need t o w at ch 
TV  and rel ax. When I feel  bett er w e can t al k." This  w oul d give him ti me t o w at ch TV  as w el l  as 
an opport unit y t o co
ol  off and prepare himself t o l i st en t o his part ner's hurt  wi t hout  maki ng 
her hurt feel i ngs w rong.
 
 
She 
may not  l i ke t his  response, but  she w il l  respect  it . O f cours e she wants  him t o be his  usual 
l ovi ng sel f, but  i f he needs t o pul l  aw ay, t hen that is his vali d need. He cannot  gi ve w hat  he 
doesn't  have. What  he can do i s avoi d maki ng things w orse. The sol ut
ion l i es i n respect i ng his 
needs as w ell  as hers . He shoul d t ake t he time he needs and t hen go back and gi ve her w hat she 
needs.
 
 
When a man can't  l ist en t o a w oman's hurt  feel ings because he needs t o pul l  aw ay, he can say "I 
underst and you feel  hurt  and I
 
need some ti me t o t hi nk about i t . Let's t ake a t ime
-
out ." For a 
man t o excuse himself in t his  w ay and st op li st ening i s much better t han t ryi ng t o expl ai n aw ay 
her hurt .
 
 
What She Can DoInstead of Arguing
 
 
In heari ng t his  suggest ion, Cat hy sai d, "If  he g
et s t o be i n hi s cave t hen w hat about  me?  I give 
him  space, but  w hat  doI get ?"
 
 
 
 
79
 
 
What Cat hy gets i s t he best  her part ner can give at  t he ti me. By not  demanding t hat he li sten to 
her w hen she w ant s t o t al k, she can avoi d maki ng t he problem much w orse by hav
i ng a huge 
argument . Second, she gets  hi s support  w hen he comes back
-
w hen he i s t rul y capabl e of 
supporti ng her.
 
 
R emember, i f a man needs t o pul l away li ke a rubber band, w hen he ret urns he w il l  be back 
w it h a lot  more love. Then he canl i st en. This ist h
e best  ti met o ini ti at econvers at i on.
 
 
A cc ept i ng a man's need t o go i nto t he cave does not  mean givi ng up t he need t o t al k. It  means 
givi ng up t he demand that he l ist en w henever she wants t o t al k. Cat hy l earned t o accept t hat 
someti mes a man can't  li st en o
r t al k and l earned t hat at other ti mes he could. Ti mi ng was very 
i mport ant. She w as encouraged not  t o give up i niti at i ng convers at i on but  t o fi nd t hose other 
t i mesw hen he coul d li sten.
 
 
When a man pull s aw ay i s t he ti me t o get more support fr om fri ends. I
f Cat hy feels t he need to 
t al k but  Harri s can't  l ist en, t hen Cat hy coul d t al k more w it h her fr iends. It  put s too much 
press ure on a man t o make him t he onl y sourc e of l ove and support. When a w oman's w ave 
cr ashes and her part ner i s i n his cave, i t is essen
t i al  t hat she have other sourc es of support. 
O t herwi seshe can't  help but f eel  powerless  and resent  her part ner.

Chri s s ai d, "I am c ompl et el yconfused.Whenw e got  marr ied we w ere poor. We bot h worked

Marti ans t end t o t hi nk money i s t he sol ution to al l  probl ems. When Chri s and Pam w ere poor

But  as t hei r li fe i mproved fi nanci al l y she continued t o get upset  fr om ti me t o ti me. H e couldn't

Chri s did not  reali ze that money coul d not  prevent Pam fr om being upset . When her w ave

A  Weal t hyWoman N eeds More Permi ssi on t o Be U pset
 
 
I remem ber rea
ding t his quote i n an arti cle: "A w eal t hy w oman can only get  empat hy fr om a 
w ealt hy psychi at rist ." When a w oman has a l ot  of money, people ( and especial ly her husband) 
do not  give her t he ri ght  t o be upset . She has no permiss i on t o be l i ke a w ave and crash
 
from 
t i me t o t ime. She has no permi ssi on t o expl ore her feel i ngs or t o need more i n any area of her 
l i fe.
 
 
A  w oman w i th money is expect ed t o be ful fi ll ed al l  t he ti me because her l ife coul d be so much

on i s not onl y impract ical  but 
dis respect ful . R egardl ess  of w ealt h, st at us, pri vil ege, or circ ums t ances, a w oman needs 
permissi on t o be upset and al l ow  herw ave t o crash.
 
 
Chri s w as encouraged w hen he reali zed he coul d make hi s w ife happy. H e remembered he
 
had 
vali dat ed his  w i fe's feeli ngs w hen t hey w ere poor, and he could do i t  again even i f t hey w ere

got t en si det racked by thinking hi s money should make her happy whe
n real l y his cari ng and 
underst andi ng of her had been thesource of her content ment .
 
 
FEE LING SA RE I MPOR TAN T
 
 
If  a w oman is not  support ed i n being unhappy someti mes  t hen she can never t rul y be happy. 
To be genuinel y happy requir es di ppi ng down i nto t he w el
l  t o rel ease, heal, and purify t he 
emoti ons. This is a nat ural  and healt hy process .
 
 
If  we are t o feel  t he posi ti ve feeli ngs of l ove, happiness, t rust , and grat it ude, w e peri odicall y 
al so have t o feel  anger, sadness, fear, and sorr ow . When a w oman goes dow
n i nto her w ell  is 
w hen shecan heal  t hese negat i ve emot i ons.
 
 
Men also need t o process  t hei r negati ve feeli ngs so t hat  t hey can t hen experi ence t hei r posit i ve 
feeli ngs. When a man goes i nt o his cave i s a t i me w hen he si lentl y feel s and proces ses hi s 
negat
i ve feeli ngs. In chapter  11 w e w il l  expl ore a t echnique for rel easi ng negat i ve feel i ngs t hat 
w orksequall y wel l forw omenand men.
 
 
When a w oman is on t he upsw i ng she can be ful fi ll ed wi t h w hat  she has. But  on t he 
dow nsw i ng she t hen wil l  become aw are of w h
at  she is mi ssi ng When she i s feel i ng good she i s

l ovi ng vi si on becomes  cl oudy, and shereact smore t ow hat i smiss i ng 'm herl i fe.
 
 
Just as a gl ass of w at er can
 
be view ed as half full  or hal f empt y, w hen a w oman is on her way

Wi t hout  l earni ng about how  w omen are l i ke w aves men cannot  unders t and or support  t heir

Men and w omen general l y are unaware t hat  they have di ffer ent  emot i onal  needs. A s a res ult  
t hey do not  i nsti nct i vely know how  t o support each ot her
. Men t ypi cal l y gi ve i n rel at i onshi ps 
w hat men w ant , w hi l e w omen gi ve w hat  w omen w ant. Each mi stakenl y ass umes  t hat  t he ot her 
has t hesam e needs anddesi res.A s ares ul t t heybot h end up diss at i sfi ed and res ent ful .
 
 
Bot h men and w omen feel  t hey give and gi

unacknowl edged and unappreciat ed. The t ruth i s t hey are bot h gi ving l ove but  not  i n t he 
desi red manner.
 
 
For example, a w oman t hinks she i s being l oving w hen she asks a l ot of car i ng quest i ons or 
expresses co

st art  t o feel  control led and w ant s pace. She i s c onfused, because i f she w ere off ered t hi s kind of 
support she w oul d be apprec iati ve. H er efforts t o be l ovi ng are at  best  i gnore

annoyi ng.
 
 
Sim il arl y, men t hi nk t hey are being l ovi ng, but  t he w ay t hey express  t heir  l ove may make a 
w oman feel  i nvali dated and unsupport ed. For exampl e, w hen a w oman get s upset , he t hi nks he 
i s l oving and support ing her by maki ng comm ent s 
t hat mi ni mi ze t hat i mport ance of her

ass umi ng he is givi ng her a l ot  of "
space" t o cool  off and go i nto her cave. What  he t hi nks i s 
support makes her f eel mi nim

U nderst andi ng Your Primar yN eeds
 
 
Cert ai nl y every man and w oman ult imatel y needs al l  t w el ve kinds of l ove. To acknow ledge t he 
si x kinds of l ove pri mari l y needed by w omen does not  impl y t hat  men do not  need t hese ki nds 
of l ove. Men al so need car i ng, unders
t andi ng, res pect , devot i on, validati on, and reass urance. 
What Is  meant by "primary need" i s t hat  ful fi ll ing a pri mar y need i s requir ed before one i s able 
ful l yt o recei ve and apprec i at et he ot her ki nds of l ove.
 
 
A  man becomes  full y recept i ve t o and appreci
ati ve of t he si x ki nds of l ove primari l y needed by 
w omen (cari ng, understandi ng, res pect , devoti on, vali dati on, and reassurance) w hen hi s own 
pri mary needs are first  ful fi ll ed. Li kew i se a w oman needs t rust , acc eptance, appreci at i on, 
admi rati on, approval, a
nd encouragement . But before she can t rul y value and appreci at e t hese 
kinds ofl ove, her pri mary needs fi rst must  be ful fil l ed.
 
 
U nderst andi ng t he primar y ki nds of l ove t hat  your part ner needs i s a powerf ul secret for 
i mprovi ng rel at i onshi ps on Eart h. R eme
mberi ng t hat  men are fr om Mars  wi l l help you 
rem ember andacc ept  t hat  men have diff erent  pri mar y l ove needs.
 
 
It 's easy for a w oman to give w hat  she needs and forget  t hat her favori t e Marti an may need 
somet hi ng el se. L i kew ise men t end t o focus on their  nee
ds, l osi ng trac k of t he fact  t hat t he kind 
of l ovet hey needi s not al w ays appropri at e for or s upport i ve of t hei rfavori t e V enusi an.
 
 
The most  pow erful  andpracti cal  aspect  oft his  new  underst andi ng of l ove is  t hat  t hese diff erent 
kinds of l ove are reci pro
cal . For example, w hen a Mart i an express es his car i ng and 
underst andi ng, a V enusi an automat i cal ly begi ns t o reci procat e and ret urn t o hi m t he t rust  and 
acc eptance t hat he primari l y needs. The same thing happens w hen a V enusi an expresses  her 
t rust
-
aMart i an
 
aut omatical l y wi ll  begi nt o reci procat ew it h the cari ng she needs.
 
 
In t he fol l ow i ng six sect i ons w e w il l defi ne the tw el ve kinds of l ove i n pract ical t erm s and 
reveal t hei r r eci procal nat ure.
 
 
1. She N eeds Cari ng and HeN eeds Trust
 
 
When a man shows i nteres t i n a w oman's feeli ngs and heartfelt  concern for her w el l
-
being, she 
feel s l oved and cared for. When he makes her feel  speci al  i n t hi s caring w ay, he succeeds in 
ful fi ll i ng her fi rst  primary need. N at ural l y she begi ns t o t rust  him 
more. When she t rust s, she 
becomes more open and rec ept i ve.
 
 
When a w oman's at ti t ude i s open and rec ept i ve towar d a man he feels t rust ed. To trust  a man is 
t o beli eve t hat he i s doing his  best  and t hat he w ants t he best  for hi s part ner. When a w oman's 
reac
ti ons reveal  a posi ti ve bel i ef i n her man's abili ti es and i ntent i ons, his first  pri mary l ove 
need i sful fi ll ed.A utomat i call y he is m ore c ari ng and attenti ve to her feel i ngs and needs.
 
 
2. She N eedsU nderst anding andH e NeedsA cceptance
 
 
 
 
83
 
 
When a man li st ens
 
w ithout j udgment  but w i th empat hy and rel at edness  t o a w oman express 
her feel i ngs, she feel s heard and underst ood. A n underst andi ng at ti tude doesn't  presume to 
al ready know  a person's t houghts or feel i ngs; inst ead, i t  gat hers meaning fr om w hat i s heard, 
a
nd moves t oward val idati ng w hat  i s being communicated. The more a w oman's need t o be 
heard and underst ood is ful fi ll ed, t he easi er i t i s for her t o give her man t he accept ance he 
needs.
 
 
When a woman l ovi ngly' rec ei ves a man w it hout t ryi ng to change hi m, h
e feel s accepted. An 
acc epti ng at ti t ude does not  rej ect  but  affi rms  that he i s bei ng favorabl y recei ved. It does not 
mean t he w oman bel i eves he i s perfect  but  i ndicat es t hat she i s not  t rying t o i mprove him , t hat 
she trusts hi m t o make his  ow n i mprovement s
. When a man feel s acc ept ed it  i s much easi er for 
him t o li sten and gi ve her t he underst andi ngshe needs and deser ves.
 
 
3. She N eeds Respect  and HeN eedsA ppreci at i on
 
 
When a man res ponds t o a w oman i n a w ay t hat acknowl edges and pri ori ti zes her ri ght s, 
wi
shes, and needs, she feels res pected. When his  behavi or takes i nto consi derati on her 
t houghts and feeli ngs, she i s sure t o feel respect ed. Concr et e and physi cal  expressi ons of 
res pect , l i ke fl ow ers and rem emberi ng anni versar i es, are essenti al  t o fulf il l  a 
w oman's t hird 
pri mary l ove need. When she feel s res pect ed i t  i s much easi er for her t o give her man t he 
apprec iati on t hat  he deserves.
 
 
When a w oman acknowl edges havi ng rec ei ved personal benefit  and val ue fr om a man's eff ort s 
and behavior, he feel s apprec i
at ed. A ppreci ation i s t he nat ural  react ion t o bei ng support ed. 
When a man i s apprec iat ed he knows  hi s eff ort  i s not  w ast ed and i s t hus encouraged t o Ove 
more. When a man i s apprec i at ed he i s aut omat i cal l y empow ered and mot ivated t o respect  his 
part ner more
.
 
 
4. She N eeds Devoti on and H eN eedsA dmi rat i on
 
 
When a man gives pri ori t y t o a w oman's needs and proudly commi ts hims elf t o support i ng and 
ful fi ll i ng her, her fourt h pri mar y love need is  ful fil l ed.A  w oman thrives w hen she feels adored 
and speci al . A  man
 
ful fi l ls her need to be l oved i n t hi s w ay w hen he makes her feeli ngs and 
needs more i mport ant  than his  other i nt erest s
-
li ke w ork, st udy, and recreati on. When a w oman 
feel s t hat  shei s numberone i n his li fet hen, quite easil y, she admi res him.
 
 
Just  as a w oman needs t o feel  a man's devot i on, a man has a primar y need t o feel  a w oman's 
admi rati on. To admi re a man i s t o regard him w it h w onder, deli ght, and pleas ed approval . A 
man feel s admi red w hen she i s happil y amazed by his uni que characteri st ics
 
or tal ent s, w hi ch 
may i ncl ude humor, st rengt h, persi st ence, i ntegri t y, honest y, romance, ki ndness, l ove, 
underst andi ng, and ot her socal l ed old
-
fas hi oned vir t ues. When a man feel s admi red, he feel s 
sec ureenough to devot e him sel ft o his w oman and adore her
.
 
 
5. She N eedsV ali dati on and H eN eeds A pproval
 
 
When a man does not objec t t o or argue w it h a w oman's feeli ngs and wants  but i nst ead accepts 
and confi rms  t hei r vali dit y, a w oman t rul y feel s l oved because her fift h primar y need is 
ful fi ll ed. A  man's val i d
at i ng at ti t ude confi rms  a w oman's ri ght  t o feel  t he way she does. ( It is 
i mport ant t o remem ber one can vali dat e her point  of vi ew w hi l e having a diff erent poi nt  of 
view .)  When a man l earns how  t o l et a w oman know t hat he has t hi s val i dat i ng att it ude, he i s
 
ass ured of gett i ng t he approvalt hat he primari ly needs.
 
 
 
84
 
 
 
Deep i nsi de, every man w ants  t o be his  w oman's hero or kni ght  i n shi ning armor. The si gnal 
t hat he has pass ed her test s i s her approval. A  w oman's approvi ng att it ude acknow l edges t he 
goodness i n a 
man and expresses overal l  sati sfact i on w it h him. (R emember, gi ving approval to 
a man doesn't  alw ays mean agreei ng w it h him.) A n approving at ti t ude rec ognizes or l ooks for 
t he good reas ons behi nd w hat  he does. When he rec ei ves t he approval  he needs, i t beco
mes 
easi er f or hi mt o val i date her feel i ngs.
 
 
6. She N eeds Reass urance and He N eeds Encouragement
 
 
When a man repeat edly shows t hat he car es, underst ands, res pect s, validates . and i s devot ed to 
his  partner, her pri mary need t o be reas sured i s ful fil l ed. A  
reass uri ng at ti t ude tell s a w oman 
t hatshe is c onti nual l yloved.
 
 
A  man comm onl y makes t he mist ake of t hinki ng t hat once he has met  al l  of a w oman's primary 
l ove needs, and she feel s happy and secure, t hat  she shoul d know fr om then on t hat  she is 
l oved. Th
i s i s not t he case. To fulfil l her sixt h pri mary l ove need he must  rem ember t o reass ure 
her again and agai n. 
 
 
Sim il arl y, a man primari l y needs t o be encouraged by a w oman. A  w oman's encouragi ng  
at ti t ude gi ves hope and courage t o a man by expressi ng confi d
ence i n his  abi li ti es and 
charact er. When a w oman's at ti t ude expresses  trust , accept ance, appreci ati on, admirati on, and 
approval i t encourages a man t o be all  t hat  he can be. Feel i ng encouraged moti vates hi m t o gi ve 
her t hel ovi ngreassurance t hat  she need
s.
 
 
The best comes out i n a man w hen his si x pri mary love needs are fulfill ed. But w hen a w oman 
doesn't  know  w hat  he pri maril y needs and gives a cari ng l ove rat her t han a trusti ng l ove, she 
may unknowi ngl y sabotage thei r r el at i onshi p. This  next  st ory exemp
li fies t hi s point .

Deep i nsi de every man t here is a hero or a kni ght  i n shi ning arm or. More t han anyt hing, he 
w ants t o succ eed i n serving and prot ect i ng t he w oman he l oves. When he feels t rust ed, he is 
able t o t ap i nt o t hi s no

t rust ed hel osessomeof his  al i veness  andenergy, and after aw hil e hecan st op cari ng.
 
 
Im agi ne a kni ght i n shi ning arm or t raveli ng through t he count rysi de. Suddenly he hears  a 
w oman cryi ng out  i n di stres s. In an i nst ant  he comes  ali ve. Urgi ng his hors e t o a gall op, he 
rac es t o her castl e, w here she i s t rapped by a dragon. The noble kni ght  pu
l l s out  his  sw ord and 
sl ayst he dragon. As a resul t , he i s l ovi ngl yrec eived by t he pri ncess .
 
 
A s t he gat es open he i s w el comed and cel ebrat ed by t he famil y of t he pri ncess and t he 
t ownspeopl e. H e i s i nvi t ed t o li ve i n t he t own and i s acknow l edged as a her

pri ncess  fal l i nl ove.
 
 
A  month l at er t he nobl e kni ght  goes off  on another t ri p. O n hi s w ay back, he hears his bel oved 
pri ncess  cr yi ng out for hel p. Anot her dragon has at t acked the castl e. When the kni ght  arri ves he 
pul l s out  his sw ordt o sla

Bef ore he swi ngs, t he pri ncess  cri es out  fr om t he t ow er, "Don't  use your sw ord, use t hi s noose. 
It w i ll w ork bet t er."
 
 
 
85
 
 
 
She t hrow s hi m t he noose and moti ons t o him i nst ruct i ons about how t o use it . H e hesit antl y 
fol l ow s her i nst ructi ons. H e w
raps it around t he dragon's neck and t hen pull s hard. The dragon 
dies  and everyonerej oi ces.
 
 
A t  t he cel ebrati on dinner t he kni ght  feels he didn't real l y do anyt hing. Somehow, because he 
used her noose and di dn't use hi s sw ord, he doesn't quit e feel w ort hy
 
of t he t own's t rust  and 
admi rati on. Aft er t he event he is sl i ght l y depressed and forgets t o shi nehis  armor.
 
 
A  mont h l at er he goes on yet anot her t ri p. A s he l eaves w it h his sw ord, t he pri nces s remi nds 
him  t o be car eful  and tel l s him t o t ake t he noose. O
n hi s w ay home, he sees  yet  anot her dragon 
at t acki ng t he castl e. This t ime he rushes forw ard w it h his  sw ord but  hesi t at es, t hinki ng maybe 
he shoul d use t he noose. In t hat  moment  of hesi t at i on, t he dragon breat hes fi re and burns his 
ri ght arm . In confusi on 
he looks up andsees his pri ncess w aving fr om the cast l ew i ndow .
 
 
"U se t he poi son," she yel l s. "The noose doesn't w ork."
 
 
She t hrow s him t he poi son, w hich he pours into t he dragon's mout h, and t he dragon di es. 
Ever yonerej oi ces and cel ebrat es, but  t he kni g
ht feels as hamed.
 
 
A  month l at er, he goes on anot her t ri p. As he leaves wi t h his sw ord, the pri ncess remi nds him 
t o be caref ul , and t o bri ng t he noose and t he poi son. H e is annoyed by her suggesti ons but 
bri ngst hemj ust  i ncas e.
 
 
This  t ime on his j ourney 
he hears anot her woman i n di stres s. A s he rushes t o her cal l, his 
depres si on i s l ift ed and he feel s confi dent and al ive. But  as he draws his sw ord t o sl ay t he 
dragon, he agai n hesi tat es. H e w onders , "Shoul d I use my sw ord, t he noose, or t he poi son? 
Whatw o
uldt he pri ncess s ay?"
 
 
For a moment  he is confused. But  t hen he remem bers  how  he had fel t  before he knew  t he 
pri ncess , back in the days w hen he only car ri eda sw ord. Wi t h a burst  of renew ed confi dence he 
t hrows off t he noose and poi son and charges the dra
gon w it h hi s t rust ed sw ord. H e sl ays t he 
dragon and the t ow nspeopl e rej oice.
 
 
The kni ght  i n shi ning arm or never ret urned t o his  pri ncess . He st ayed i n t hi s new  vi ll age and 
l i ved happil y ever aft er. H e event ual l y marr ied, but  onl y aft er maki ng sure hi s new

Love oft en fads because people i nsti ncti vel y give w hat t hey want. Because a w oman's primary

of

Then, w he

When a man can l i st en to a w oman's feeli ngs w it hout get ti ng angry and fr ustrated, he gives her 
a w onderful  gift . H e makes i t  saf e for her t o express  hers el f. The more she i s abl e t o express 
herself, t he 
more she feel s heard and unders t ood, and t he more she is able t o give a man t he 
l ovi ngt rust , accept ance, appreci ati on, admi rat i on, approval , and encouragement  t hat  he needs.
 
 
TH EA R TO F EMPOWER IN G A  MAN
 
 
Just  as men need t o l earn t he art  of l ist eni ng to f
ulfi ll  a w oman's primar y love needs, w omen 
need t o l earn t he art  of empowerment. When a w oman enl i st s t he support  of a man, she 
empowers  hi m t o be all t hat he can be. A  man feel s empow ered w hen he i s t rust ed, accepted, 
apprec iat ed.admi red, approved of, an
dencouraged.
 
 
Li ke i n our st ory of the kni ght i n shi ni ng arm or, many w omen t ry t o hel p t heir man by 
i mprovi ng hi m but  unknow i ngl y w eaken or hu

t he l ovi ng t rust . acc ept ance, appreci ati on, admi rat i on, approval , and encouragement  t hat  are his 
pri mary needs.
 
 
The sec ret  of empow ering a man is never t o t ry t o change hi m or improve him. Certai nl y you 
may w an
t  him t o change
-
j ust  don't act  on t hat desi re. O nl y i f he di rectl y and speci fi call y asks 
for advice is he opent oass ist ance i nchangi ng.
 
 
G i ve Trust and N ot A dvi ce
 
 
O n V enus, it  is consi dered a l ovi ng gest ure t o offer advice. But  on Mars  it  i s not . Women 
need 
t o rem ember t hat  Mart ians do not  offer  advice unl ess  it  dir ectl y request ed. A  w ay of show ing 
l ove is t ot rust  anot herMarti an to sol ve his problem s on his  ow n.
 
 
This  doesn't mean a w oman has t o squash her feel i ngs. It 's O K for her to feel  fr ust rat ed o
r even 
angry, as l ong as she doesn't  try t o change hi m. A ny att empt  t o change him  is unsupporti ve and 
count erproducti ve.
 
 
 
89
 
 
 
When a w oman l oves a man, she oft en begi ns tryi ng t o improve t hei r relati onshi p. In her 
exuberance she makes him  a t arget  for her impr
ovement s. She begins a gradual  proces s of 
sl owl y rehabil it ati ng him.
 
 
Why MenR esi st  Change
 
 
In a myri ad of w ays she t ri es t o change him or improve hi m. She t hinks her at tempt s t o change 
him  are l ovi ng, but  he feel s cont roll ed, manipulat ed, rej ect ed, and u
nloved. H e wi ll  st ubbornly 
rej ect  her because he feel s she i s rej ecti ng hi m. When a w oman t ri es t o change a man, he i s not 
getti ng t he l ovi ng t rust and acc ept ance he act ual l y needs t ochange andgrow.
 
 
When I ask a room fill ed w it h hundreds of w omen and me
n t hey al l  have had t he same 
experi ence:t he more aw omant ri est o change a man, t he more he resists.
 
 
The probl em is t hat  when a man resi sts her at t empts t o i mprove him, she misi nt erpret s his 
res ponse. She mi st akenly t hinks he i s not  wi ll i ng t o change, pr
obabl y because he does not  l ove 
her enough. The trut h is, how ever, t hat  he i s resist ant t o changi ng because he beli eves he i s not  
being l oved enough. When a man feel s l oved, t rust ed, accept ed, apprec i at ed, and so forth, 
automat icall y he begi nst o change, g
row, and improve.
 
 
Tw o Ki nds ofMen/O neKi nd ofBehavi or
 
 
There are tw o kinds of men. O ne w il l become i ncr edi bly defensi ve and st ubborn w hen a 
w oman tri es t o change him , w hi l e t he other w ill  agree t o change but  l ater w il l  forget  and revert 
back tot he ol d 
behavi or. A  man eit heracti vely resi st s or passi vely resi sts.
 
 
When a man does not feel  l oved j ust  t he w ay he i s, he wi ll  ei t her consci ousl y or unconsci ousl y 
repeat  t he behavi or t hat  i s not  bei ng accepted. H e feel s an i nner compulsi on t o repeat  t he 
behavior unt il  he feel s loved and accepted.
 
 
For a man t o im prove hims
elf he needs t o feel  l oved i n an accept i ng w ay. O t herw i se he defends 
him sel f and st ays t he same. H e needs t o feel  acc epted j ust  t he w ay he i s, and t hen he, on his 
own, wi ll  l ook forw ayst o improve.
 
 
Men Don't  Wantt o BeImproved
 
 
Just  as men want t o expl a
i n w hy w omen shouldn't  be upset , w omen want t o explai n w hy men 
shoul dn't behave t he w ay t hey do. Just  as men mi st akenl y w ant t o "fi x" w omen, w omen  
mi st akenl y tr y t o "improve" men.
 
 
Men see t he w orl d t hrough Marti an eyes. Thei r mott o is "don't fi x i t , i f i t
 
i sn't  broken." When a 
w oman att empt s t o change a man, he rec ei ves t he mes sage t hat she t hi nks he is broken. This 
hurt s aman andmakeshim  very defensi ve. H edoesn't feel l oved andacc epted.
 
 
A  man needs t o be accepted regardl ess of his  imperf ecti ons. To 
acc ept a person's i mperf ecti ons 
i s not  easy, especi al l y w hen we see how  he coul d become bett er. It  does, how ever, become 
easi er w hen w e understand t hat t he best  w ay to help him grow  is t o let  go of t ryi ng t o change 
him i n any way.

For all  pract ical purposes I st rongl y recommend t hat coupl es not argue. When t w o peopl e are 
not  sexuall y i nvolved it  is a l ot  easi er t o remai n det ached and obj ect i ve w hil e arguing or

A s a basi c gui del i ne: never argue. Inst ead disc uss  t he pros and cons of somet hi ng. N egoti at e for 
w hat you w ant  but  don't argue. It is poss i bl e t o be honest , 
open, and even express negati ve

Some coupl es fi ght  all t he t ime, and gradual ly t heir  l ove dies. O n the other extreme, some

The dif ferences and disagreements  don't  hurt  as much as t he w ays i n w hic h w e communicate

l y an argument does not  have t o be hurt ful ; i nstead i t  can si mpl y be an engagi ng

WH YA RG UMEN TS HU R T
 
 
It  i s not  
w hat 
w e say t hat hurt s but  
bow 
we say i t . Q uit e comm on
l y w hen a man feel s 
chal lenged, his  at t ent i on becomes focused on being ri ght  and he forget s t o be l ovi ng as well. 
A utomati cal l y his abil ity t o comm uni cat e i n a cari ng, res pect ful , and reass uri ng t one decreas es. 
H e i s aw are neit her of how uncari ng he sounds
 
nor of how hurt ful t his is t o hi s part ner. A t such 
t i mes, a simple dis agreement  may sound l i ke an at t ack t o a w oman; a request  t urns i nt o an 
order. Nat urall y a w oman feel s resi stant t o t his unl ovi ng approach, even w hen she w oul d be 
otherw i se recepti ve to 
the cont ent  ofw hat he was s ayi ng.
 
 
A  man unknow i ngl y hurt s hi s part ner by speaki ng i n an uncari ng manner and t hen goes on t o 
explai n w hy she shoul d not  be upset . H e mi st akenl y assumes she is resi st i ng t he content  of his 
poi nt of view , w hen real l y hi s unl o
ving delivery is w hat  upset s her. Because he does not 
underst and her react i on, he focuses  more on explai ni ng t he meri t  of what he i s sayi ng i nstead 
of correcti ng t he w ay he i s s ayi ngi t .
 
 
H e has no i dea t hat  
be is 
st arti ng an argument ; he t hinks 
she is 
arg
ui ng w i th him . H e defends 
his  poi nt  of vi ew  w hil e she defends 
her self  
fr om his  sharpened expressi ons, w hich are hurt ful 
t o her.
 
 
When a man neglects to honor a w oman's hurt feeli ngs he i nval i dat es t hem and i ncreases her 
hurt . It  is hard for him t o underst a
nd her hurt  because he i s not  as vul nerabl e t o uncari ng 
comm ent s and t ones. Consequentl y, a man may not  even reali ze how  much he is hurt i ng his 
part ner and t hus provoki ng herres ist ance.
 
 
Sim il arl y,w omen don't reali ze how  t hey are hurt ful t o men.U nl i ke a
 
man, when aw omanfeels 
chal lenged t he t one of her speech aut omat ical l y becomes i ncreasingl y mist rusti ng and 
rej ect i ng. This  ki nd of rej ect i on i s more hurt ful t o a man, especial ly w hen he is emoti onall y 
i nvolved.
 
 
Women st art and escalat e arguments by fir
st shari ng negat i ve feeli ngs about  t heir part ner' s 
behavior and t hen by giving unsol ici ted advi ce. When a w omen neglects t o buff er her negat i ve 
feeli ngs w it h messages of t rust and acc ept ance, a man res ponds negat i vel y, l eaving t he w oman 
confused.A gai n she
 
i s unawar e of how  hurtful her mi strust i st o him.
 
 
To avoi d argui ng w e need t o remem ber t hat  our part ner obj ect s not  t o w hat w e are sayi ng but 
t o how we are sayi ng i t. It  t akes tw o t o argue, but  it  onl y t akes one t o st op an argument . The

best  way t o st op

1. Fight:
 
This st ance defi nitel y comes  from Mars. When a conversati on becomes unl ovi ng and 
unsupporti ve some i ndi vidual s i nst i ncti vely begin t o fi ght . They immedi at el y move i nt o an 
offensi ve st ance. Thei r mott o i s "t he best defense i s a s
t rong offense." They st ri ke out  by 
blami ng, j udgi ng, crit i ci zi ng, and maki ng t hei r part ner l ook w rong. They t end t o st art  yel li ng 
and express  l ots  of anger. Their  i nner mot i ve i s t o i nt imi dat e t hei r part ner i nto l oving and 
supporti ng t hem. Whent heir part n

have l ost .
 
 
Int imi dat i on alw ays w eakens trust  i n a rel at i onshi p. To musc le your way i nto get ti ng w hat you 
w ant by maki ng others l ook w rong is a sure way t o fal l  i n a rel ati onship. When coupl es fi g

2. Fli ght

These Marti ans are afr ai d of confr ontat ion and w oul d rat her l i e l ow and avoi d t al king about 
any t opi cs t hat may cause an argument . They w al k on eggshel ls i n a rel at i onshi p. Women

I w ould do such a t hing. I becam e upset  wi t h her for 
being upset  wi t hme, and we had anargument.
 
 
I t hought she disapproved of my i nvestment choices  and argued for t hei r val i di t y. My 
argument  how ever w as fuel ed by my anger that she w as upset  w i th me. She 
argued t hat

w it hout expl ori ng her ideas on t he subject . In addi ti on she w as upset  t hat I w as not  respect i ng 
her ri ght  t o be upset. Eventuall y I became so upset
 
t hat she apol ogi zed t o me for

Lat er on, aft er w e had made up, she posed t hi s quest i on. She sai d, "Many t imes  w hen w e argue, 
i t  seems t hat  I get  upset  about somet hing, and t hen you get  upset  t hat I a

w oul dl i ke you t ot ell  me you are sorr y for upsett i ngme."
 
 
Im medi at el y I saw  t he l ogi c of her poi nt of view . Expecti ng an apol ogy fr om her did seem 
rat her unfai r, especiall y w hen I upset  her firs t . This  new i nsi ght  transformed our relati onshi p. 
A s I shared t his experi ence i n my semi nars I dis covered t hat t housands of w omen could

Let 's r evi ew t he basic pat t ern.
 
 
1. A w omanexpress es ber upset  feel i ngs about  "XYZ"
 
 
2. A man expl ai ns w hyshe shouldn't  be upset  about "XYZ."
 
 
3. She feel si nvali datedand becomes m ore upset . ( Shei s now  more upset  about bei ng 
i nvali dat

4. He feel s her disapproval and becomes upset . H e bl ames her for upsett i ng hi m and expect s an 
apol ogy before makingup.
 
 
5. She apol ogi zesand wondersw hat happened,or she becomes more upset  andt he argument  
esc alat es i nt o a bat t le.
 
 
Wi t h a cl earer aw areness of t he anat omy of an argument , I w as abl e t o sol ve t hi s probl em i n a 
fai rer w ay. R emembering t hat w omen are fr om V enus, I pract i ced not  blami ng her for being 
upset . Inst ead I w oul d seek t o underst and how  I had upset  her and show  
her t hat  I car ed. Even 
i f s hew asmi sunderst anding me,i f s hefelt  hurt  by me I  neededt o let  her know  t hat  Icar ed and 
w assorr y.
 
 
When she w oul d become upset  I l earned first  t o li st en, t hen genui nel y t
o try t o underst and 
w hat she w as upset  about, and t hen t o say, "I'm sorr y t hat  I upset  you when I sai d

Then I say, "I' m sorr y you feel  so upset ." A lt hough t his  i s not  an apology i t  does say "I care," 
and t hatseems  t o help a l ot.

Men rarel y say "I'm  sorry" because on 
Mars  i t  means you have done somet hi ng w rong and you 
are apol ogi zi ng. Women, how ever, say "I' m sorr y" as a way t o say "I car e about  w hat  you are 
feeli ng".
 
 
It  doesn't mean t hey are apol ogi zi ng for doi ng somet hing wrong. The men readi ng t hi s w ho 
rar el y say "
I am sorry" can cr eat e w onders by l earni ng t o use t hi s aspect  of t he V enusi an 
l anguage. Theeasiest way to derai l an argument i s t o say, "I'm s orr y."
 
 
Most  argument s esc al ate w hen a man begi ns t o invali date a w oman's f eel i ngs and she responds 
t o him di sapp
rovi ngl y. Bei ng a man, I've had to l earn t o pract ice val i dat i ng. My w ife practi ced

To avoid pain i t i si mport ant t o recognize how  men unknowi ngl y i nval i dat e and how  w omen 
unknowi ngl y sendmessages of di sapproval .
 
 
H owMenU nknowi ngly St art  Argument s
 
 
The most common w ay men st art  arguments is by i nva
li dati ng a w oman's feel i ngs or poi nt of 
view .Men don't  real izehow  much t heyi nval i dat e.
 
 
For exampl e, a man may make l i ght  of a w oman's negat i ve feel i ngs. H e mi ght say "A h, don't  
w orry about i t." To another man t his phrase w oul d seem fri endl y. But  t o a f
emal e i nti mate 
part ner i t i si nsensit i veand hurt s.
 
 
In anot her exampl e, a man mi ght  t ry t o res ol ve a w oman's upset  by saying "It 's not such a big 
deal." Then he offer s some pract ical sol ut i on t o t he probl em, expect i ng her t o be reli eved and 
happy. H e does
n't  underst and t hat she feels i nvali dated and unsupport ed. She cannot 
apprec iat e hi s soluti onunt i l he vali dat es her need to be upset .
 
 
A  very common example i s w hen a man has done somet hi ng t o upset  a w oman. Hi s i nsti nct  is 
t o make her feel  bet ter by expl
ai ning w hy she shoul dn't be upset . He confi dentl y explai ns t hat 
he has a Perf ectl y good, l ogi cal , and rat i onal  reason for w hat he di d. H e has no i dea t hat  t his 
at ti t ude makes her feel  as t hough she has no right  t o be upset . When he explai ns himself, t he 
on
l y mess ageshe ri ght hear is t hat  he doesn't care about  her f eel i ngs.
 
 
For her t o hear his good reas ons, she fi rst  needs him  t o hear her good reasons for bei ng upset . 
H e needs t o put  hi s explanati ons on hol d and l ist en wi t h underst andi ng. When he si mpl y st
arts 
t o care about her f eeli ngs s hew il l  st art  t ofeel  support ed.
 
 
This  change i n approach t akes pract ice but  can be achi eved. G eneral l y, w hen a w oman shares 
feeli ngs of frust rat i on, dis appoint ment, or w orry, 
ever y 
cell  i n a man's body i nsti ncti vel y reacts
 
w it h a li st of explanations and j ust i fi cat i ons desi gned t o explai n aw ay her upset feel i ngs. A 
man never i nt ends t o make matt ers w orse. H i s t endency t o explain aw ay feeli ngs i s j ust 
Marti an insti nct .
 
 
By underst andi ng t hat hi s aut omat ic gut  react i ons i n t h
i s i nst ance are counter producti ve, a man 
can, how ever, m ake t his shi ft. Through a grow i ng awar eness  and hi s experi ences ofw hatw orks

H OW WO MEN U NKNO WING LY STAR TA RG UMEN TS
 
 
The most  comm on way w omen unknow i ngl y st
art  arguments i s by not  being dir ect  w hen t hey 
share t heir feel i ngs. Instead of direct l y expressing her disl i ke or di sappoint ment, a w oman asks 
rhet ori cal  questi ons and unknowi ngl y ( or knowi ngl y) communicat es a mes sage of disapproval . 
Even thoughsomet imes
 
t his i s not  t hemessageshe w ant st o gi vei t i s generall y what  aman will 
hear.
 
 
For example, w hen a man i s l ate, a w oman may feel  "I don't li ke w ai ti ng for you w hen you are 
l at e" or "I was w orri ed t hat somet hi ng had happened t o you." When he arr i ves, i ns
t ead of 
dir ect l y shari ng her feeli ngs she asks a rhet ori cal  quest i on li ke "H ow  coul d you be so l at e?" or 
"What am I s upposed t ot hinkw hen you're sol ate?" or "Why di dn't  you cal l ?"
 
 
Cert ai nl y aski ng someone "Why didn't you cal l?" i s O K i f you are si ncerel
y l ooki ng for a valid 
ï11 11
a vali dansw er but  is m aking the poi ntt hat t here i s no acc eptablereas onfor bei ng l at e.
 
 
When a man hears a quest i on l i ke "H ow  could y
ou be so l at e?" or "Why didn't you cal l ?" he 
does not  hear her feel ings but  i nst ead hears  her dis approval. H e feels her i ntrusi ve desi re to 
help hi m be more res ponsi ble. H e feels at t acked and becomes defensive. She has no i dea how 
painful her di sapproval i
s t o hi m.
 
 
Just  as w omen need vali dati on, men need approval . The more a man loves a w oman t he more 
he needs her approval. It  i s alw ays t here i n t he begi nni ng of a rel at i onship. Eit her she gi ves 
him  t he message t hat she approves of him or he feel s confi dent
 
t hat  he can wi n her approval . In 
ei t her c ase t heapproval i s present .
 
 
Even if a w oman has been w ounded by other men or her fat her she w il l  sti ll  give approval  i n 
t he begi nni ng of t he rel ati onshi p. She may feel  "H e i s a speci al man, not  li ke ot hers I have
 
known."
 
 
A  w oman wi t hdrawi ng t hat approval  is part icular l y painful  t o a man. Women are general l y 
obl i vious of how  t hey pull  aw ay t heir approval . A nd w hen t hey do pul l i t  aw ay, t hey feel  very 
j usti fi ed i n doi ng so. A reas on for t hi s i nsensi ti vit y is t hat  w
omen reall y are unaw are of how 
si gnifi cant approvali sfor men.
 
 
A  w oman can, how ever, l earn t o disagree wi t h a man's behavi or and st ill  approve of w ho he is. 
For a man t o feel  l oved he needs her t o approve of w ho he i s, even if she disagrees w it h his 
beha
vior. G eneral l y w hen a w oman disagrees w it h a man's behavi or and she w ants  to change 
him , she w il l  disapprove of him . Cert ai nl y t here may be t imes  w hen she i s more approving and 
l ess approving of him, but t o be di sapprovingi svery pai nful  and hurts hi m.
 
 
Most men are t oo ashamed t o admit  how  much t hey need approval . They may go t o great 
l engt hs t o prove t hey don't care. But w hy do t hey i mmediat el y become col d, dist ant, and 
defensi ve w hen theyl ose a w oman'sapproval ?Bec ause not  get ti ngw hat  t hey need hurt
s.
 
 
O ne of t he reasons rel at i onshi ps are so succ essful  i n t he begi nni ng i s t hat a man is st i ll  i n a 
w oman's good graces . H e is st i ll  her kni ght  i n shi ning arm or. H e recei ves t he blessi ngs of her 
approval and, as a result , ri des high. But  as soon as he begi
ns t o disappoi nt her, he fal ls fr om 
grace.H el oses her approval .A ll  of asudden hei s c ast  out  i nt o the doghouse.
 
 
 
99
 
 
 
A  man can deal  w it h a w oman's dis appoi ntment, but  w hen it  i s express ed wi t h disapproval  or 
rej ect i on he feel s w ounded by her. Women comm onl
y i nt errogate a man about  hi s behavior 
w it h a dis approving t one. They do t his  because t hey t hink it  wi ll  t each him  a l esson. It  does 
not . It onl y creat es fearand res ent ment .A nd gradual l y he becomes l ess and l ess m ot i vat ed.
 
 
To approve of a man i s t o see 
t he good reasons behi nd w hat he does. Even w hen he is 
i rr esponsi bl e or l azy or dis res pectful , if she l oves him , a w oman can fi nd and rec ogni ze t he 
goodness w it hin hi m. To approve is t o fi nd the l ovi ng i nt enti on or the goodness behind t he 
out si de behavior.
 
 
To t reat  a man as i f he has no good reason for w hat he does i s t o w it hhol d t he approval  she so 
fr eel y gave i n t he begi nning of t he rel ati onshi p. A  w oman needs t o remember t hat she can sti ll 
give approval  even when she di sagrees.
 
 
O ne cri ti cal  pai r of prob
l ems fr om w hi ch arguments  ari se:
 
 
1. The man feels t hat  t he w oman di sapproves ofhis  poi nt  of vi ew .
 
 
2. O rt hew oman di sapproves oft hew ay the man is  tal ki ng t o her.
 
 
WH EN H EN EEDS MOR EA PPROV AL THAN MO ST
 
 
Most  argument s occur not  because t w o peopl e dis ag
ree but  because ei t her t he man feels t hat 
t he w oman disapproves of hi s poi nt of view  or the w oman di sapproves of t he w ay he is tal ki ng 
t o her. She oft en may dis approve of him because he i s not  vali dating her poi nt of vi ew or 
speaking t o her i n a caring w ay
. When men and w omen l earn
 
to approve and vali date, the y don 't 
have to ar gu e. The y can discuss and ne goti ate diff erenc es.
 
 
When a man makes a mi st ake or forget s t o do an err and or ful fi ll  some r esponsi bil i ty, a w oman 
doesn't  reali ze how  sensi ti ve he feel s.
 
Thi s is w hen he needs her l ove t he most . To wi t hdraw

I rem ember once l eaving for a vacat i on w it h my wi fe. A s w e drove off i n t he car  and could 
fi nall y rel ax fr om a hect i c w eek, I expect ed Bonni e t o be happy t hat  w e w ere goi ng on such a 
great
 
vacat i on. Inst ead she gave a heavy si gh and sai d, "I feel  l i ke my li fe i s a l ong, sl ow 
t ort ure."
 
 
I paused, t ook a deep breat h, and t hen repli ed, "I know w hat you mean, I feel  l i ke t hey are 
squeezing every ounce of l i fe out  of me." A s I sai d t his I made a
 
motion as i f I w ere wri ngi ng 
t he wat er out  of a rag.
 
 
Bonni e nodded her head i n agreement and t o my amazement she suddenl y smil ed and t hen 
changed t he subj ect . She st art ed t al k

ago t his  w oul d not  have happened. We w oul d have had an argument and I w oul d have 
mi st akenl y bl amed it  on her.
 
 
I w oul d have been upset  wi t h her for sayi ng her li fe w as a l ong, sl ow  t ort ure. I w oul
d have 
t aken it  personall y andfel t t hat  shew ascompl ai ning about  me. Iw oul d have become defensi ve 
and explai ned t hat our li fe w as not  a t ort ure and t hat she shoul d be grateful  t hat  w e were goi ng 
on such a wonderful  vacat i on. Then w e w oul d have argued an
d had a long, t ort urous vacati on. 
A ll  t hi sw oul d have happened because I di dn't underst and and vali dat e her feel i ngs.
 
 
This  ti me, I underst ood she w as j ust  expressi ng a passi ng feel i ng. It w asn't  a st at ement  about 
me. Because I underst ood t his  I didn't  get
 
defensi ve. By my comment about being w rung out 
she felt  com
plet el y val idated. In response, she w as very acc ept i ng of me and I fel t  her l ove, 
acc eptance, and approval . Because I have l earned t o vali
date her feel i ngs, she got  t he l ove she 
deserved.We did

Scori ng Poi nts wi t h
 
t he Opposit e Sex
 
 
A  man t hinks he sc ores high wi t h a w oman w hen he does some
t hing very bi g for her, l i ke 
buying her a new  car or t aki ng her on a vacat i on. H e ass umes  he scores l ess w hen he does 
somet
hi ng small , l i ke opening t he car door, buying her a fl ow er, or giving her a hug. Bas ed on 
t his  kind of score keeping, he beli eves he w il l  fulf il l  her best  by focusing his  t ime, energy, and 
at t ent i on i nt o doi ng some
t hing l arge for her. This  form ul a, how eve
r, doesn't  w ork because 
w omen keep score diff erent l y.
 
 
When a w oman keeps sc ore, no mat t er how  big or sm all  a gif t  of l ove i s, i t  scores  one poi nt ; 
each gift  has equal  value. It s size doesn't  matt er; it  gets  a poi nt . A  man, how ever, t hinks he 
sc ores one po
i nt  for one sm all  gift  and t hirt y poi nts  for a bi g gift . Si nce he doesn't  underst and 
t hatw omen keep scoredif ferentl y, he nat ural l y focuses hi senergi esi nto one or tw o big gi ft s.
 
 
A  man doesn't  reali ze t hat  t o a w oman t he li tt le things are j ust  as i mport
ant as t he bi g thi ngs. I n 
other w ords, to a w oman, a si ngl e rose get s as many poi nts as payi ng the rent  on ti me. Wi t hout 
underst andi ng t his basi c differ ence i n sc ore keepi ng, men and women are conti nuall y 
fr ustrated and disappointed i nt heir r el ati onships.
 
 
The foll owi ng case il l ust rates t hi s:
 
 
In counsel i ng, Pam sai d, "I do so much for Chuck and he i gnores me. A ll  he cares about i s his 
w ork."
 
 
Chuck sai d, "But  my work pays for our beaut i ful house and al l ow s us t o go on vacat i ons. She 
shoul d be happy."
 
 
Pam repl i ed, "I don't  care about t hi s house or the vacati ons if w e are not  l ovi ng each other. I 
need morefr om you."
 
 
Chuck sai d, "You makei t  soundl i ke you gi ve so much more."
 
 
Pam sai d, "I do. I am al w ays doi ng t hings for you. I do t he w ash, fi x t he mea
l s, cl ean t he 
house
-
everyt hi ng. You do one t hing
-
you go t o w ork, w hi ch does pay t he bil ls. But  t hen you 
expect met o do everyt hing el se."
 
 
Chuck i s a successf ul  doct or. Li ke most  professi onal s hi s w ork i s very ti me consumi ng but  very 
profit able. H e coul dn'
t  underst and w hy his  w ife, Pam, w as so disc ontent. H e earned a "good 
l i ving" and he provi ded a "good l i fe" for his  w ife and fam il y, but  w hen he cam e home his  w i fe 
w as unhappy.
 
 
In Chuck's mi nd, t he more money he made at  w ork, t he l ess  he needed t o do at  ho
me t o fulfill 
his  w ife. H e t hought hi s heft y paycheck at  t he end of t he month scored him  at  least  t hirt y 
poi nts . When he opened his  own cl i ni c and doubled his  i ncome, he ass umed he w as now 
sc ori ng si xt y poi nt s a mont h. H e had no i dea t hat  his paycheck earn
ed him  onl y one poi nt  each 
monthw it h Pam
-
no matt er how  bigi t w as.
 
 
 
 
106
 
 
Chuck did not  reali ze that fr om Pam's  poi nt of view , t he more he earned, t he l ess she got . H is 
new cl i ni c requi red more ti me and energy. To pic k up t he sl ack she began t o do even more to 
manage t hei r personal li fe and rel at i onshi p. A s she gave more, she felt  as i f she w as sc ori ng 
about si xt y poi nts a m onth t o hi s one. Thi smade her very unhappy andres entful .
 
 
Pam felt  she w as givi ng much more and get ti ng l ess. From Chuck's point of view h
e w as now 
givi ng more ( si xty poi nts)  and shoul d get more fr om hi s wi fe. In his mind t he score w as even. 
H e w as sati sfi ed w it h their  rel at i onshi p except for one t hing
-
she w asn't  happy. H e bl amed her 
for w anti ng t oo much. To him , hi s i ncreased pay equal ed w h
at  she was givi ng. This at ti t ude 
made Pam evenmore angry.
 
 
A fter l i st ening t o my rel ati onshi p course on t ape, bot h Pam and Chuck w ere able t o let  go of 
t heir blame and sol ve t hei r problem w it h love. A rel ati onshi p headed for divorc e w as 
t ransformed.
 
 
Chuc
k l earned t hat  doing l it tl e t hi ngs for hi s w i fe made a big difference. He was amazed at 
how  qui ckl y t hings changed w hen he st art ed devot i ng more t ime and energy t o her. He began 
t o appreciat e t hat  for a w oman l it tl e t hings are j ust as important as big t hi n
gs. He now 
underst oodw hy hi sw ork scored onl y one poi nt.
 
 
A ct uall y, Pam had good reas on t o be unhappy. She trul y needed Chuck's pers onal  energy, 
eff ort , and at t ent i on much more t han t heir w eal t hy l i fe
st yl e. Chuck disc overed t hat by 
spendi ng l ess energy m
aking money and devot i ng j ust  a li tt l e more energy i n t he ri ght 
dir ect i on, his wi fe w oul d be much happi er. He rec ogni zed t hat  he had been w orking l onger 
hours i n hopes of making her happi er. O nce he underst ood how she kept sc ore, he could come 
home wi t ha 
new confi dence because he knew  how t omake her happy.
 
 
LI TTLE  TH ING S MA KE A BIG  DIFFER EN CE
 
 
There are a vari et y of ways a man can sc ore points  wi t h hi s part ner wi thout havi ng t o do much. 
It  i s j ust  a mat t er of 
redirec ti ng t he energy and at t ent i on he is already giving. Most  men al ready 
know about  many of t hese t hi ngs but  don't  bother t o do t hem because t hey don't  real ize how 
i mport ant t he li t tl e t hi ngs are to a w oman. A  man t rul y beli eves t he l it tl e t hi ngs are 
in
si gni fi cant  w hencompared tot he big thi ngshe is  doi ng for her.
 
 
Some men may st art  out i n a rel at i onshi p doi ng t he l it tl e t hi ngs, but  havi ng done t hem once or 
t wi ce t hey st op. Through some myst eri ous i nstinct i ve forc e, t hey begi n t o focus t hei r energies 
i nto doi ng one bi g t hi ng for t hei r part ners . They t hen negl ect  t o do all  t he li tt l e t hings t hat  are 
necessary for a w oman t o feel ful fil l ed i n t he rel ati onshi p. To fulfil l a w oman, a man needs t o 
underst and w hat  she needs t o feel l oved andsupport ed.
 
 
The 
w ayw omensc ore point si s not  j ust  a pref erence but  a t rue need. Women needmany 
expressi ons of l ove i n arel at i onshi p to feel  l oved. One ortw o expressi ons of l ove, no mat ter 
how  import ant,w il l  not , and cannot ,fulfil l  her.
 
 
This  can be extrem el y hard fo

TH E MAG ICO F DO ING  LI TTLE  TH IN G S
 
 
It 's magi c w hen a man does li tt l e t hi ngs f or hi s w oman. It keeps her l ove t ank full  and t he score 
even. When t he score i s even, or al most  even, a w oman know s she i s loved, w hich makes her 
more t rust i ng and l oving i n ret urn. When a woman know s she's l oved, 
she can l ove w it hout 
res entment .
 
 
Doing l it tl e t hi ngs for a w oman i s al so heal i ng for a man. In fact , t hose li t tl e t hings wi ll  t end t o 
heal hi s resentment s as w el l as hers. H e begins t o feel  pow erf ul and eff ect i ve because she's 
getti ng t he cari ng she needs
. Bot h aret hen ful fi lled.
 
 
What aMan Needs
 
 
Just as men need t o conti nue doi ng l it tl e t hings for a w oman, she needs t o be parti cul arly 
at t ent i ve to appreci at e the li tt l e t hi ngs he does for her. Wit h a smil e and a t hanks she can let 
him  know  he has scored
 
a poi nt. A  man needs t hi s appreci at i on and encouragement  t o conti nue 
givi ng. H e needs t o feel  he can make a diff erence. Men st op giving w hen t hey feel t hey are 
being taken for granted. A  woman needs t o l et  hi m know  t hat w hat he i s doi ng i s appreci at ed.
 
 
T
his  doesn't mean t hat she has t o pret end t hat  everythi ng i s now perfect l y w onderf ul  because 
he has empt i ed t he trash for her. But  she can si mpl y not ice t hat  he has empti ed t he t rash and 
say "t hanks."G radual l ymorel ove wi ll  fl ow fr om both si des.
 
 
What aM
an Needs aWoman toA ccept
 
 
A  w oman needs t o acc ept a man's i nst i nct i ve tendenci es t o focus al l his energies i nt o one bi g 
t hing and mi nimi ze t he i mport ance of t he li tt l e t hings. By acc ept i ng t his i ncli nati on, it  wi ll  not 
be as hurt ful  t o her. R ather t han r
esent i ng hi m for givi ng l ess , she can const ruct i vel y work w it h 
him  t o sol ve t he probl em. She can repeatedly let  him know how  much she appreci at es t he li tt le 
t hings he has donefor her and that  hew orks hard and attenti vely.
 
 
She can remem ber t hat his  forge
tt i ngt o do theli t tl et hings doesn't mean he doesn't l ove her but 
t hat he has become t oo focused on big t hings again. Inst ead of fi ght i ng him  or punis hing him, 
she can encourage his pers onal  i nvolvement  by aski ng for his  support. Wi t h more appreci ati on

A fter reading about her feeli ng negl ected I reali zed t hat  I t rul y w a

exhaust ed and i gnore my wife.
 
 
When a ManO verw orks
 
 
I w as i gnori ng her not  because I didn't  l ove her or car e for her but  because I had not h
i ng l eft  to 
give. I nai vel y t hought I w as doi ng t he best thing by w orki ng hard t o provi de a bet ter l ife 
( more money)  for her and our fami l y. O nce I unders t ood how  she felt , I devel oped a pl an for

Inst ead of seei ng ei ght  cl i ent s a day I st art ed seei ng seven. I pretended t hat  my w ife w as my

G radual l y, as I felt  being l oved for t he w ays I coul d support  her and our fa

H owa Women Can Help
 
 
Bonni e's support played a big part  i n t his change. In addit i on t o shari ng her honest and l ovi ng 
feeli ngs, she w as al so very persist ent  i n aski ng me t o do t hi ngs for her and t hen givi ng me a l ot

for doi ng li t tl e t hings. I w as reli eved fr om feel ing t hat I had t o do great  t hi ngs t o be l oved. It 
w as arevel ati on.
 
 
 
WH EN  WO MEN GIVEPOIN TS
 
 
Woman possess  t he
 
speci al  abil i ty t o appreciat e t he l it tl e t hi ngs of fi fe as much as t he big 
t hings. Thi s is a blessi ng for men. Most  men stri ve for great er and greater success  because t hey 
beli eve i t wi ll  make t hem w ort hy of l ove. Deep i nsi de, t hey cr ave l ove and admi rati
on from 
others . They do not know  t hat t hey can draw  t hat  l ove and admi rati on to t hem w it hout havi ng 
t o be a great er s uccess.
 
 
A  w oman has t he abi li ty t o heal  a man of t hi s addi ct i on t o succ ess by appreci ati ng t he li tt le 
t hings he does. But she may not  expr
ess  apprec iat i on i f she doesn't  unders t and how  i mport ant 
i t  is t oa man. She may let  herres ent ment  get  i nt he way.
 
 
H EA LING  THE RESENTMEN T FLU
 
 
Women i nsti ncti vel y apprec i at e t he li tt l e t hings. The onl y excepti ons are w hen a w oman 
doesn't  reali ze a man ne
eds t o hear her appreci ati on or w hen she feels t he score i s uneven. 
When a w oman feel s unloved and negl ect ed i t i s hard for her automatical l y t o appreciat e w hat 
a man does do for her. She feels resent ful  because she has given so much more t han he has. 
This
 
resentment  bl ocksher abil it y to appreci atet he li tt l et hings.
 
 
R esent ment , li ke get ting t he fl u or a cold, i s not  heal t hy. When a w oman i s si ck w it h 
res entment  she t ends t o negat e w hat  a man has done for her because, acc ordi ng t o t he w ay a 
w oman keeps sc
ore,she has done somuchmore.
 
 
When t he score i s fort y t o t en i n favor of t he w oman, she may begi n t o feel very resentful. 
Somet hi ng happens t o a w oman w hen she feels sh
e i s givi ng more t han she i s gett i ng. Q uite 
unconsci ousl y she subt ract s his sc ore of t en fr om her sc ore of fort y and concl udes t he sc ore in 
t heir rel ati onshi p is t hi rt y t o zero. This makes sense mat hemati cal l y and i s underst andable, but 
i t  doesn't w ork.
 
 
W
hen she subt ract s hi s s core from her sc ore he ends up wi t h a zero, and he i s not  a zero. H e has 
not  given zero; he has gi ven t en. When he comes home she has a col dness  i n her eyes or i n her 
voi ce t hat  says he i s a zero. She i s negat i ng what he has done. Sh
e react s to him  as i f he has 
given nothi ng
-
but  he has gi vent en.
 
 
The reas on a w oman t ends t o reduce a man's point s t his w ay is because she feel s unl oved. The 
unequal  score makes her feel  unl oved. Feeli ng unl oved, she fi nds it  very diffi cul t t o appreci ate 
even t het en point s he can legit imatel ycl ai m.Of c ourse, t hi si sn't fai r, but i t i s how i t w orks.

The soluti on t o t his r esentm ent  i s for her t ot ake res ponsi bil it y.
 
 
She needs t o t ake responsi bil it y for havi ng cont ri but ed t o her problem by gi ving more and

a res t  fr om givi ng so much i n t he rel at i onshi p. She needs t o pamper hersel f and all ow her 
part ner t ot ake care of her m ore.
 
 
When a w oman feel s resent ful , she usual l y wi ll not  gi ve her part ner 
a chance t o be supporti ve, 
or, if he t ri es, she wi ll  negat e t he val ue of w hat  he has done and give him anot her zero. She 
cl oses t he door t o his  support . By t aking res ponsi bil it y for gi ving t oo much, she can give up 
blami ng him for t he probl em and st art  a n

w it h her new  unders tanding, improvet he si t uati on.
 
 
WhatH e Can Do
 
 
When a man feel s unappreci at ed, he st ops giving support . A  w ay he can res ponsi bly deal  wi th 
t he si t uat i on i s t o underst and t hat i t i s har

him w hen shei ssi ck wit h resentment.
 
 
H e can rel ease his own res ent ment  by underst andi ng t hat  she needs t o rec ei ve for a w hi le 
before she can gi ve again. He can remem ber t hi s as he at t ent i vel y gi ves 
his  l ove and affect i oni n

It  helps i f he t akes responsi bil it y for gi ving her t he fl u because he neglect ed t o do t he li tt le

Wi t h t hi s f

WH Y MEN G IV E LE SS
 
 
A  man rarel y i ntends to t ake more and give less . Yet  men are not orious for givi ng l ess  i n 
rel at i onshi ps. Probabl y you have experi enced t his i n your rel at i onshi ps. Wom
en commonly 
compl ai n t hat t hei r male part ner st art s out  more l ovi ng and t hen graduall y becomes pass ive. 
Men al so feel  unfairl y t reat ed. In t he begi nning w omen are so appreci at i ve and l ovi ng, and 
t hen t hey become res ent ful  and demandi ng. Thi s myst ery can be
 
underst ood w hen w e real i ze 
how  menand w omen keep score differ ent l y.
 
 
There arefi vemaj or reasons a man st ops gi vi ng. They are:
 
 
1. Mart i ans Ideal i ze Fairnes s. 
A  man focuses all  his energies i nto a proj ect at  w ork and t hinks 
 
 
115
 
 
he has j ust  sc ored fi ft y poi n
t s. Then he comes home and si t s back, wait i ng for his  w ife t o sc ore 
her fi ft y poi nts . H e does not know t hat  i n her experi ence he has onl y sc ored one poi nt . H e st ops 
givi ng because he t hi nks he has al ready givenmore.
 
 
In his mi nd t hi s i s t he fai r and l ovi n
g t hi ng t o do. H e al l ow s her t o give fi ft y poi nt s w ort h of 
support  t o even t he sc ore. H e doesn't  real i ze that his  hard w ork at  t he office sc ores  onl y one 
poi nt. Hi s model of fairness can w ork onl y w hen he underst ands and respects w omen give one 
poi nt f or e
ach gift  of l ove. This  firs t i nsi ght  haspracti cal  appli cat i ons f or both men and w omen. 
They are:
 
 
For Men: R emem ber t hat  for a w oman, bi g t hings 
and 
l it tl e t hi ngs sc ore one poi nt. Al l gift s of 
l ove are equal  and equal l y needed
-
bi g and smal l . To avoi d crea
t i ng resentm ent , practi ce doi ng 
some of t he l it tl e t hi ngs t hat make a big diff erence. Do not  expect  a w oman t o be sati sfi ed 
unl ess she get s an abundance ofl it tl e expressi ons of l ove asw ell  as t hebig.
 
 
For Women: R emem ber t hat men are from Mars ; t hey are
 
not aut omat ical l y moti vat ed t o do t he 
l i tt le t hi ngs. They gi veless  not  because t hey donot  l ove you but  because t hey bel i eve t hey have 
al ready gi ven t hei r share. Try not  t o t ake it  pers onall y. Inst ead, repeat edly encourage t hei r 
support  by aski ng for mor
e. Don't  w ai t , unt il you desperat el y need his  support or unt il  t he 
sc ore i s greatl y uneven t o ask. Don't  demand hi s support; t rust  t hat he w ant s t o support  YOU , 
even i f he needs a li t tl eencouragement .
 
 
2. Venusi ans Ideali ze U ncondi ti onal Love. A 
woman giv
es as much as she can and onl y notices 
t hat she has received l ess  w hen she is empt y and spent. Women don't st art  out  keeping sc ore 
l i kemen do;w omengive fr eel y and ass ume men wil l  dot he same.
 
 
As 
w e have seen, men are not  t he sam e. 
A 
man gives freel y un
t il  t he sc ore, as he perc ei ves it, 
gets  uneven, and t hen he st ops gi ving. 
A 
man generall y gi ves a l ot and t hen si ts back t o receive 
w hat he has gi ven.
 
 
When a w oman i s happy givi ng t o a man, he i nst i ncti vely ass umes she i s keeping sc ore and he 
must have mo
re poi nts. The l ast  t hing he w oul d consi der i s t hat  he has given l ess . From his 
vant age poi nt hew oul dnever c ont i nue gi ving when t he score becam e uneven i n his f avor.
 
 
H e knows t hat  if he i s requir ed t o give more w hen he feel s he has al ready gi ven a great
er 
amount , he wi ll  defi nit el y not  smil e w hen he gives. Keep t hi s i n mi nd. When a w oman 
conti nues t o give freel y w it h a smi le on her face, a man assumes t he score must  be somew hat 
even. H e does not  real ize t hat  Venusians have t he uncanny abil it y t o give hap
pi l y unt il  the 
sc ore i s about t hirt y t o zero. These i nsi ght s al so have practi cal  appli cat i ons for bot h men and 
w omen:
 
 
For Men: Remember t hat  w hen a w oman gives w it h a smil e on her face i t  doesn't  necess ari l y 
mean t he sc ore is c l oseto even.
 
 
For Women: R e
mem ber t hat w hen you give fr eel y t o a man, he get s t he message t he score i s 
even. If  you w ant  t o moti vat e him t o gi ve more, t hen gent l y and graceful l y st op gi ving more. 
Al l ow 
him t o do l it tl e things for you. Encourage him  by aski ng for hi s support  i n li tt l
e w ays 
and t hen appreciati ng hi m.
 
 
3. Marti ans Gi ve When They Are  Asked. 
Mart ians pri de t hems el ves in being sel f
-
suffi ci ent . 
They don't ask for hel p unl esss t hey real l y need i t . O n Mars it  i s rude to offer help unl ess  you 
 
 
116
 
 
are fi rst  asked.
 
 
Q uit e t he oppos
it e, Venusi ans don't  w ait  t o offer t heir support . When they l ove someone, t hey 
give i n any w ay t hey can. They do not  w ait  t o be asked, and t he more t hey l ove someone t he 
moret hey give.
 
 
When a man doesn't offer  hi s support a w oman mist akenl y ass umes he do
esn't  l ove her. She 
may even t est  his  l ove by defi nit el y not  aski ng for his support  and wai ti ng for hi m t o offer it . 
When he doesn't off erto hel p, she resents  hi m.She does not underst and that  he is w ai ti ng t o be 
asked.

When a w oman doesn't ask for support , a man mist akenl y ass umes t he sc ore must be even or

This  t hi rdi nsi ght  has pract ical appli cat i onsforbot h men and w omen
 
 
For Women: R emember t hat a man l ooks for cues t el l i ng him  w hen and how  t o give more. He 
w ait s 
t o be asked. H e seems  t o get  t he necess ary feedback onl y w hen she i s aski ng for more or 
t ell i ng hi m he needs t o give more. In addi ti on, w hen she asks, he know s w hat t o give. Many 
men don't know w hat to do. Even i f a man senses  he i s givi ng l ess, unl ess  she

For Men: R emember t hat  a w oman i nsti nct i vely does not  ask for support  w hen she w ants i

Inst ead, she expects you t o off er it  if you l ove her. Pr act ice offeri ng to support  heri n li tt le w ays.
 
 
4. Venusi ans Say Yes  Even When the Score Is  Uneven 
Men don't  reali ze t hat w hen t hey ask for 
support , a w oman wi ll  say yes even i f t he sc ore i s uneven
. If  t hey can support  t hei r man, t hey 
w il l . The concept of keeping sc ore i s not  on her mi nd. Men have t o be caref ul not  t o ask for t oo 
much. If she feels she is givi ng more t han she i s get t i ng, aft er a w hil e she wi ll  resent t hat you 
do not  offer t osupport
 
her more.
 
 
Men mist akenl y assume t hat as l ong as she says yes t o his needs and request s, she i s rec ei ving 
equal l yw hat  shew ant s. H e mi st akenl y assumes t he score is evenw henit  i sn't .
 
 
I remem ber taking my w i fe t o t he movi es about once a w eek for t he fi r
st  tw o years  of our 
mar ri age. O ne day she became furi ous w it h me and sai d, "We alw ays do w hat you w ant  t o do. 
We never dow hat  Iw ant  t o do."
 
 
I w as genui nely surpri sed. I t hought t hat  as l ong as she sai d yes and conti nued t o say yes t hat 
she w as equal l y happyw it h thesit uati on. It hought s hel i kedt hemovies as much as I di d.
 
 
O cc asi onal l y shew oul dsuggest t o me t hat  t he opera w asi n tow n ort
hat she w oul d li ke to go t o 
t he symphony. When w e drove by t he l ocal  playhouse, she w oul d make a remar k l i ke "That 
l ooks li ke fun, l et 'ssee that pl ay."
 
 
 
117
 
 
 
But  t hen lat eri n the w eek I w oul d say, "Let 's go t o thi s m ovie,i t 's gotagreat revi ew ."
 
 
A nd shew o
uld happil ysay, "O K."
 
 
Mi st akenl y, I got  t he mes sage t hat she w as as happy as I w as about goi ng t o t he movies. In 
t rut h she w as happy t o be w it h me, t he movie w as O K, but  w hat 
she 
w anted w as t o go t o t he 
l ocal  cul t ural  events . That  i s w hy she kept  menti on
i ng t hem t o me. But  because she kept  sayi ng 
yes t ot he movi es, I hadno i dea that  she was s acri fi ci ng herw ants t omake me happy.
 
 
This  i nsi ght  has practi cal  appli cat i onsfor bot hmen andw omen.
 
 
For Men: R emem ber t hat  if she says yes t o your requests, i t 
doesn't  mean t he sc ore is even. The 
sc ore may be t wenty t o zero i n her mi nd and she wi ll  st il l happil y say "Sure I'll  pick up your 
cl othes at t hecl eaners " or "OK ,I' ll  make that  cal l for you."
 
 
A greei ng t o doi ng w hat  you w ant doesn't  mean t hat i t i s w hat  
she wants . A sk her w hat she 
w ants t o do. Coll ect  i nform at i on about  w hat she l i kes, and t hen offer t o take her t o t hose 
plac es.
 
 
For Women: Remember t hat i f you i mmediat ely say yes t o a man's request s, he get s t he i dea 
t hat he has given more or t hat  t he sco
re i s at  l east  even. If you are gi ving more and get ti ng l ess, 
st op sayi ng yes t o hi s r equest s.Inst ead, in a graceful w ay, begi n aski nghim t o do more f or you.
 
 
5. Marti ans G i ve Penal ty Points . 
Women don't  reali ze t hat  men give penalt y poi nts  w hen t hey 
fee
l  unl oved and unsupport ed. When a w oman reac ts t o a man i n an unt rusti ng, rej ect i ng, 
dis approvi ng, or unappreci at i vew ay, he gives mi nus or penalt y point s.
 
 
For exampl e, i f a man feel s hurt  or unl oved because his w i fe has fai l ed to appreci ate somet hi ng 
he'
s done, he feel s j ust ifi ed i n t aki ng aw ay t he poi nts she has al ready earned. If  she has given 
t en, w hen he feel s hurt  by her, he may react  t o her by t aki ng aw ay her t en poi nts . If he i s more 
hurt  he may even give her a negat i ve tw ent y. A s a res ul t  she now  
owes him t en poi nt s, w hen a 
mi nute before s he had ten points.
 
 
This  i s very confusi ng t o a w oman. She may have given t he equivalent of t hirt y poi nt s, and 
t hen i n one angry moment  he t akes t hem away. In his  mi nd he feels j usti fied i n not  givi ng 
anyt hing bec
ause she ow es hi m. H e t hinks i t  i s fai r. Thi s may be fai r mat hemati cal l y, but  it  is 
not  real l yfair.
 
 
Penal t y poi nts are destruct i ve t o rel at i onshi ps. They make a w oman feel  unappreci at ed and a 
man l ess gi ving. If he negates i n his mi nd all  the l ovi ng supp
ort she has gi ven, w hen she does 
express some negati vit y, w hic h i s boundt o happen occ asi onall y, het henl oses hi smoti vati on to 
give. H e becomes  passi ve. This  fift h i nsi ght  has practi cal  appl icati ons for bot h men and 
w omen.
 
 
For Men: R emember t hat  penal t y
 
poi nts are not  fai r and do not  w ork. A t  moment s w hen you 
feel  unl oved, offended, or hurt , forgi ve her and rem ember al l  t he good she has given rat her 
t han penal ize her by negat i ng it  al l. Inst ead of punis hing her, ask her for t he support you w ant, 
and she 
wi ll  give it . Respect ful l y let  her know  how she has hurt  you. Let her know how  she has 
hurt  you and t hen give her an opport uni t y t o apol ogi ze. Puni shment  does not  w ork! You w ill 
feel much bett er by giving her a chance t o gi ve you w hat  you need. R emem ber sh
e i s a 
 
 
118
 
 
V enusi an 
-
 
she doesn't know w hat  you need orhow  she hurt s you.
 
 
For Women: R emem ber t hat  men have t his t endency to gi ve penalt y poi nts. There are tw o 
approaches t o prot ect  yourself f rom t hi s abuse. 
 
 
The fi rst  approach i s t o rec ogni ze t hat he is w
rong i n taking aw ay your poi nts. In a respect ful 
w ay l et him know how you feel . In t he next chapter  w e wi ll  explore w ays t o expres s diff icult  or 
negat i ve feel i ngs.
 
 
The sec ond approach i s t o recogni ze he t akes aw ay poi nts w hen he feel s unl oved and hurt  and
 
he imm edi atel y gives them back w hen he feel s l oved and support ed. As he feel s more and 
more l oved for t he li tt l e t hings he does, he w i ll  graduall y give penalt y poi nts  l ess  and l ess. Try 
t o underst andt he diff erent ways he needs l oveso t hat  he doesn't  get
 
hurt  asmuch.
 
 
When you are abl e t o recogni ze how  he has been hurt , l et  him know that you are sorr y. Most 
i mport ant, t hen give hi m t he l ove he didn't get. If  he feel s unapprec i at ed, give him  t he 
apprec iati on he needs; if he feel s rej ect ed or manipulat ed, 
give him t he acc eptance he needs; if 
he feels mi strusted, give him  t he t rust  he needs; i f he feels put  dow n, give him t he admirati on 
t hat he needs; i f he feel s disapproval , give him t he approval  he needs and deserves. When a 
man feel sl oved hew il l qui t  us
i ng penal t y poi nts.
 
 
The most  di ffi cul t  part of t he above process i s knowi ng w hat  hurt him. For t he most  part , w hen 
a man wi t hdraws i nt o hi s cave, he doesn't  know  w hat hurt him. Then, w hen he comes out , he 
generall y doesn't  t al k about it . H ow  i s a w oman su
pposed t o know  w hat act ual l y hurts his 
feeli ngs?  R eading t his book and underst anding how  men need l ove dif ferentl y i s a good 
begi nni ng and gives you an edge t hat w omen have never had before.
 
 
The other w ay a w oman can l earn w hat happened is t hrough communi
cat i on. A s I have 
menti oned before, t he more a w oman is able to open up and share her feeli ngs i n a respect ful  
w ay, the more a man isable t ol earn t o open upand share hi s hurt  and pai n.
 
 
H OW MEN G IV E PO INTS
 
 
Men give poi nts dif ferentl y fr om w omen. Every 
t i me a w oman appreci at es w hat  a man has 
done for her, he feel s l oved and gives her a poi nt i n ret urn. To keep t he sc ore even i n a 
rel at i onshi p, a man reall y doesn't requi re anyt hi ng but  l ove. Women don't reali ze t he power of 
t heir l ove and many t imes  unnec
essari l y seek t o earn a man's l ove by doi ng more t hi ngs for 
him t han t heyw ant  t o do.
 
 
When a w oman appreci at es w hat a man does for her, he gets much of t he l ove he needs. 
R emember, men pri mari l y need appreci ati on. Cert ai nly a man al so requi res equal  part i
ci pat i on 
fr om a w oman i n doi ng t he domesti c dut i es of day
-
to
-
day li fe, but  i f he is not  appreci at ed, t hen 
her contri but i oni s nearly meaningl ess and complet el y unimport antt ohim .
 
 
Sim il arl y, a w oman cannot  appreci ate t he big things a man does for her unl e
ss  he i s also doi ng 
a l ot of li tt l e t hings. Doing a l ot  of l it tl e t hi ngs fulfil l s her pri mary needs t o feel  car ed for, 
underst ood,and respected.
 
 
A  maj or sourc e of l ovefor a mani s t hel ovi ng react i ont hat  a w oman has t o hi s behavior.H e has 
a l ove tank 
t oo, but  hi s i s not  necessari l y fil l ed by w hat  she does for him. Inst ead it  i s mai nly 
fi ll ed by how  shereact st o him or how
-
 
she feel s about him.
 
 
 
119
 
 
 
When a w oman prepares a meal  for a man, he gi ves her one poi nt  or t en poi nts , dependi ng on 
how  she is feeli ng t ow ard him. If a w oman sec ret l y res ent s a man, a meal  she may cook for him 
w il l  mean very l it tl e t o hi m
-
he may even givemi nus point s because she 
w as r esent i ng him. The 
sec ret  t o ful fi ll i ng a man l i es i n l earni ng t o expres s l ove t hrough your feel i ngs, not  neces sarily 
t hrough youracti ons.
 
 
Phi l osophi cal l y speaking, w hen a w oman feels l ovi ng, her behavi or w i ll  automat icall y express 
t hat l ove. When a 
man express es hims el f i n lovi ng behavi or, automat i cal l y his feeli ngs w il l 
fol l ow  and becomemore l ovi ng.
 
 
Even i f a man is not  feeli ng his  l ove for a w oman, he can sti ll  deci de t o do somet hi ng l ovi ng for 
her. If  his  offeri ng i s recei ved and appreci ated, th
en he w i ll  begi n t o feel  his  l ove for her again. 
Doing is  an excel l ent w ay to prime aman's l ovepump.
 
 
H owever, w omen are very differ ent . A  w oman generall y does not feel  loved i f she doesn't feel 
car ed about, unders t ood, or res pected. Making a deci si on t o
 
do somet hing more for her part ner 
w il l  not  help her feel  more l ovi ng. Inst ead it  may act uall y fuel  her resentm ent . When a w oman 
i s not  feeli ng her l oving feel i ngs, she needs t o focus her energi es dir ect l y on heal i ng her 
negat i ve feel i ngs and defi nit el y no
t  on doi ng more.
 
 
A  man needs t o pri orit ize "l ovi ng behavior," for t hi s wi ll  ensure t hat hi s part ner' s l ove needs 
are met . It  w il l  open her heart  and also open his heart  t o feel  more l ovi ng. A  man's heart  opens 
as he succeedsi n ful fi ll ing a w oman.
 
 
A  w oma
n needs t o pri orit i ze "l ovi ng at ti t udes and feel i ngs." w hi ch wi l l ensure t hat her 
part ner's l ove needs are ful fil l ed. A s a w oman i s able t o expres s l ovi ng at t it udes and feel i ngs 
t oward a man, he feel s mot ivated t o give more. This t hen assi st s her i n openin
g her heart  even 
more.A w oman's heart opens more asshe is able t o get  t hesupport sheneeds.
 
 
Women are somet imes  unaw are of w hen a man reall y needs l ove. At  such ti mes  a w oman can 
sc oret w ent yt o thi rt y poi nts . These are some exampl es:

When a Woman Can Score MorePoint s
 
 
Eac h oft he above examples  reveals how menscore poi nt s diff erentl y from w omen. But  a 
w omani
s not  requi redto do all  of t he above. Thi s li st  reveal st hoset imes w hen he i smost  
vul nerabl e. If s hecan be supporti vem gi vi ng hi mw hat he needs he wi ll  be verygenerous i n 
givi ng poi nts.
 
 
A s I ment i onedi n chapter 7, aw oman's abi li t yto gi ve love at  
di ffi cul t t imes  fl uct uates li ke a 
w ave.When aw oman'sabili t yt o gi ve l ovei si ncr easi ng ( duri ngt he upsw i ng of herw ave)  is 
 
 
121
 
 
t he ti mew henshe canscore many bonus poi nts. She shoul d not  expect herself t o be asl ovi ng 
at  other ti mes.
 
 
Just  as aw oman's ab
i l ity to give l ovefl uct uat es, a man's need for l ove fluct uates. I neach of t he 
above exampl es, t here is no fi xedamount  for how  many poi nts aman gives. Inst eadt herei s an 
approximat e range;w hen hi s needfor her l oveis great er het endst o gi ve her more
 
poi nt s.
 
 
For exampl e, i f he has made a mist ake and feel s embarrass ed, sorry, or ashamed, t hen he needs 
her l ove more; t heref ore he gives more poi nt s if she res ponds by bei ng supporti ve. The bigger 
t he mi st ake, t he more point s he gi ves her for her l ove. If
 
he doesn't recei ve her l ove he t ends t o 
give her penalt y poi nt s acc ordi ng t o how  much he needed her l ove. If  he feel s rej ect ed as t he 
res ult  of a bi gmi st ake he may gi ve al ot of penalt y point s.
 
 
WHA T MA KES MEN  DEFEN SIVE
 
 
A  man may become so angry at  a w o
man w hen he has made t he mist ake and t he w oman is 
upset . Hi s upset is proport i onal  t o t he size of his mi st ake. A li tt l e mi st ake makes hi m l ess  
defensi ve, w hi le a big mi st ake makes hi m much more defensi ve. Someti mes w omen w onder 
w hy a man doesn't  say he i s 
sorry for a big mist ake. The answ er i s he i s afr ai d of not  bei ng 
forgi ven. It  i s t oo pai nful t o acknow ledge t hat  he has fail ed her i n some w ay. Inst ead of sayi ng 
he is  sorr y hemay become angryw it h her f or bei ng upset  and gi ve herpenal t y poi nts.
 
 
When a 
man i s i n a negat i ve st ate, i f she can t reat  him  l i ke a passi ng t ornado and l i e l ow , after 
t he t ornado has passed he w i ll  give her an abundance of bonus poi nt s for not  maki ng him 
w rong or for not  tryi ng t o change hi m. If  she t ries t o st op t he t ornado it w i
l l  creat e havoc, and 
he wil l  bl ame herfori nterf eri ng.
 
 
This  i s a new  i nsi ght for many woman because on Venusw hen someone i s upset  t he V enusi ans 
never i gnore her or even consi der l ying l ow . Tornadoes don't  exist  on V enus. When someone is 
upset  everyone g
ets i nvolved wi t h one anot herand t ries t o unders tand w hati s botheri ng her by 
aski ng al ot of quest i ons. When a t ornado pass es on Mars everyonefi nds a ditch and li esl ow .
 
 
WH EN  MEN  GIVE PENA LTY PO IN TS
 
 
It  helps greatl y w hen w omen underst and t hat  men sc or
e poi nts dif ferentl y. That men give 
penal t y poi nt s i s very confusi ng t o w omen and doesn't  make it  safe for women t o share t heir 
feeli ngs. Cert ai nl y, i t  woul d be w onderful  if an men could see how  unfai r penal t y poi nts  are 
and change overni ght
-
but change tak
es ti me. What can be reass uri ng for a w oman, how ever, is

Some people are very good at  writ i ng out  t hei r negat i ve feel i ngs but  have 
a hard t ime fi ndi ng 
t he feeli ngs of l ove. It is especi al l y import ant for t hese peopl e t o write R esponse Let t ers  and 
explore w hat  t hey w oul d want t o hear i n ret urn. Be sure t o feel  your own resi st ance about 
l ett i ng your part ner support  you. This gives you a
n added aw areness about how  di ffi cul t  i t 
must  be for your part ner t o deal  l ovi ngl y wi t h you at  such t imes.
 
 
H owWe Can LearnA bout O ur part nersN eeds
 
 
Someti mes w omen obj ect  t o w ri t i ng R esponse Let t ers . They expect t hei r part ners t o know w hat 
t o say. They 
have a hidden feel i ng t hat says "I don't w ant  t o t el l  him w hat I need; i f he real ly 
l oves me he w il l  know." In t his  case a w oman needs t o remem ber men are fr om Mars  and don't 
know w hat w omen need; they needt o bet old.
 
 
A  man's response i s more a refl ect i o
n of his planet t han a mi rror of how  much he l oves her. If 
he w ere a V enusi an, he w oul d know  w hat  t o say, but  he i s not . Men real l y don't  know how  t o 
res pond t o a w oman's feel i ngs. For t he most part , our cul t ure doesn't  t each men w hat w omen 
need.
 
 
If  a man
 
has seen and heard hi s fat her res pond w it h l oving w ords t o his mot her's upset 
feeli ngs, t hen he w oul d have a bett er i dea about  w hat  t o do. As it  i s, he doesn't know because 
he's never been t aught . R esponse Let ters  are the best  w ay t o t each a man about a w
oman's 
needs. Sl ow l y, but  surely, he wi l l l earn.
 
 
Someti mes w omen ask me "l f I t el l  him w hat  I w ant t o hear, and he start s sayi ng it , how  do I 
know he is notj ust  saying i t ?I' m afrai d hemaynot  real l ymeani t ."
 
 
This  i s an import ant quest i on. If  a man do
esn't l ove a w oman he wi ll  not  even bot her to give 
her w hat  she needs. If  he even att empt s t o gi ve a res ponse simil ar t o her request , t hen most 
l i kel y he is r eal l yt ryi ng t o respond.
 
 
If  he doesn't s ound ful ly si ncere it 's because hei s l earni ng somet hi ng 
new. L earni ng a neww ay 
of res pondi ng is aw kward. To him  i t  may feel w eak. This  i s a cri ti cal t i me. H e needs l ot s of 
apprec iati on and encouragement . H e needsfeedback tel li ng him he's on t he ri ght t rac k.
 
 
If  his  att empt s t o support  her seem  somew hat i nsi nc
ere, i t  i s usuall y because he i s afr ai d his 
eff ort s w il l not  w ork. If a w oman appreci at es his att empt , t he next  t ime he wi ll  feel  more sec ure 
and t hus be able t o be more si ncer e. A  man i s not  a fool . When he feel s t hat  a w oman is 
rec epti ve t o hi m and t hat  
he can respond i n a w ay t hat makes a posit ive differ ence, he wi ll  do 
i t . It  j ust t akes t ime.
 
 
Women as w el l  can l earn a l ot about  men and w hat t hey need by heari ng a man's R esponse 
Lett er. A w oman is generall y perpl exed by a man's reacti ons t o her. She has
 
no i dea w hy he 
rej ect s her att empt s t o support  hi m. She mi sunderst ands w hat  he needs. Someti mes she resists 
him  because she t hinks he w ants her t o gi ve up herself. In most  cases , however, he reall y wants 
her t ot rust , appreci at e,and acc ept  him.
 
 
To rec ei
ve support  w e not onl y have to t each our part ners w hat w e need but w e al so have t o be 
w il li ng t o be support ed. R esponse Let ters  ensure t hat  a person i s open t o being support ed.

1. H e reads her Love Let t er and R esponse Lett er out  l oud w hil e she i s present. Then he hol ds 
her hands and gi ves his own l ovi ng response w it h a great er aw areness  of w hat  she needs t o

2. She re ads her  Love Lette r and Res ponse  Lett er out l oud w hi le he is li stening.
 
Then he hol ds her 
hands and gives his own lovingres ponse wi t ha greater aw areness  ofw hatshe needs t o hear.
 
 
3. Fir st  he reads her Res ponse  Letter  out l oud to her . 
Then he r
eads her Love Let t er out  l oud. It is 
much easier for a man t o hear negat i ve feeli ngs w hen he already knows  how t o res pond to 
t hose feeli ngs. By l et ti ng a man know  w hat  is requi red of him, he doesn't panic as much w hen 
he i s heari ng negat i ve feeli ngs. A ft er
 
he reads her Love Let t er he t hen hol ds her hands and 
gives hi s ow n lovi ng response wi t h agreat er awareness ofw hatshe needs t o hear.
 
 
4. Fir st s he re ads her  Response Lette rto him . 
Then she reads herLove Lett er out  l oud. Fi nall y he 
hol ds her hands and 
gi ves her al ovi ng res ponse w it h a great er aw areness of w hat  she needs.
 
 
5. She gi ves her let ter s to him and he reads them pri vatel y w ithi n tw enty

f our hours. 
Aft er he has 
read t he l et t ers , he t hanks her for w ri ti ng t hem and hol ds her hands and gives her a
 
l ovi ng 
res ponsew it h a greateraw areness  of w hat  she needs.
 
 
 
 
 
Bas ed on t hei r past  experi ences some men and w omen have great  dif fi cult y heari ng Love 
Lett ers . In t hi s case t hey shoul d not  be expect ed t o read
 
one. But  even w hen your part ner 
chooses  t o hear a l et t er, someti mes t hey are unable t o respond ri ght  aw ay i n a l ovi ng manner. 
Let 's t ake Paul  and Theresa as  an exampl e.
 
 
If  Paul  i s not  feeli ng more l ovi ng aft er he has heard his  part ner's l ett ers , t hen i t  
i s because he 
can't res pondw it h loveat  t hat  ti me. But  aft ert ime his f eel i ngs wi ll  change.
 
 
When reading t he lett ers, he may feel  att acked by t he anger and hurt and become defensi ve. At 
such ti mes he needs t otake a ti meout  t orefl ect on w hatw as s ai d.
 
 
Someti mes w hen a person hears a Love Lett er they onl y hear t he anger and i t  w il l  t ake a w hi l e 
before t hey can hear t he l ove. It  hel ps i f, aft er a bit , he rereads t he l et ter, especiall y t he regret 
and l ove sect i ons. Somet i mes before I read a Love Let t er fr o
m my wi fe, I read t he l ove sect i on 
fi rst  andt hen Ireadt heful l l ett er.
 
 
If  a man i s upset  aft er reading a Love Let t er, he could also respond w it h his ow n Love Lett er, 
w hic h w oul d all ow him t o proces s t he negat ive feel i ngs t hat came up w hen he read her L
ove 
 
 
134
 
 
Lett er. Somet imes I don't  know  w hat  i s bot hering me unti l my wi fe shares a Love Let t er w it h 
me, and t hen suddenly I have somet hing t o w rit e about . By wri ti ng my l ett er I am abl e t o fi nd 
again my l ovi ng feel i ngs and reread herl et t er and hear t he l ove b
ehi ndher hurt .
 
 
If  a man cannot i mmediat el y respond w it h l ove, he needs t o know  that it 's OK and not  be 
punis hed. Hi s part ner needs t o underst and and acc ept  hi s need t o think about  t hi ngs for a 
w hil e. Perhaps, t o support  hi s part ner, he can say somet hi ng 
l i ke "Thank you for w ri ti ng t his 
l ett er. I need some ti me t o t hink about it  and t hen w e can t al k about It ." It  i s i mport ant  t hat  he 
not  express  crit i cal  feelings about t he let ter. Shari ng lett ers  needst o be a saf et ime.
 
 
A ll  of t he above suggest i ons for s
hari ng Love Lett ers also appl y w hen a w oman has diffi cul t y 
res pondi ng t o a man's let t er i n a l ovi ng way. I generall y recommend that coupl es read out  l oud 
t he l et ters  t hey have wri t ten. It  is helpful  t o read your part ner's let ter out l oud because it  helps 
t
hemfeel  heard.Experiment w it h both, and see w hatfit s you.
 
 
 
MA KING  IT SA FE FOR LOV ELE TTER S
 
 
Shari ng Love Let t ers can be scar y. The pers on w rit i ng t hei r true feeli ngs wi ll  feel  vul nerabl e. If 
t heir part ner rej ect s t hem it  can be very painful. The purpose of shari ng t he l et t er is t o open up 
feeli ngs so t hat part ners can become cl oser . It w orks w el l
 
as l ong as t he process i s done in

A s w e have explored throughout  t hi s book, it i s vastl y important for w omen t o share t heir 
feeli ngs and feel  cared for, underst ood, and respect ed. It  i s equal l y import ant  for men t o feel

ps occurs  w hen a w oman 
shares  her upset  feeli ngs and, as a res ul t ,a manfeel s unl oved.
 
 
To him , her negati ve feel i ngs may sound cr it ical , blami ng, demandi ng, and res ent ful . When he 
rej ect s her feel i ngs, s he then feels unl oved. The success of a rel ati onshi
p i s sol el y dependent  on 
t w o fact ors: a man's abi l it y t o li sten l ovi ngl y and res pect full y t o a woman's feel i ngs, and a 
w oman's abi l it yt o share her feel i ngs i n a l ovi ngand res pect ful w ay.
 
 
A  rel at i onshi p requires t hat part ners comm unicat e t heir changi ng f

To expect  comm uni cat ion alw ays t o be easy is unreali st ic. Some feelings are
 
very difficult  t o

The Power  of I nt imac y
 
 
Pri vat el y writ i ng Love Lett ers is very heali ng in i tself, but  i t does not replace o
ur need t o be 
heard and underst ood by others. When you wri t e a Love Lett er you are l ovi ng yours elf, but 
w hen you share a l ett er you are rec ei ving love. To grow i n our abi li t y to l ove ours el ves w e need 
t o recei ve l ove as w ell . Shari ng t he t rut h opens t he do
or of i ntimac y through w hi ch l ove can 
enter .
 
 
To rec eive more love we need t o have peopl e in our li fe w it h w hom we can openl y and safel y 
share our feel i ngs It  i s very pow erful t o have some sel ect people i n your li fe w i t h w hom you 
can share your every feel i
ng and trust t hat  they w il l sti ll  l ove you and not  hurt  you w ith 
cr it i ci sm, j udgment, or rej ect i on.
 
 
When you can share w ho you are and how  you feel , t hen you can full y recei ve l ove. If  you have 
t his l ove, it  i s easi er t o rel ease negati ve emoti onal sympt om
s li ke res entm ent , anger, fear , and 
so fort h. Thi s does not  mean t hat you need t o share everyt hi ng you feel  and discover i n pri vate. 
But  i f t here are feeli ngs t hat you are afrai d t o share, t hen gradual l y t hese fears  need t o be 
healed.
 
 
A  l ovi ng t herapist o
r close fri end can be a tremendous source of l ove and heal i ng if you can 
share your i nner and deepest feel i ngs. If you don't  have a t herapist , t hen havi ng a fri end read 
your l et ters fr om t ime to t ime i s very helpful . Writ i ng i n pri vat e wi ll  make you feel  b
et ter; but 
occasi onall y shari ng your Love Let t ers  w it h anot her pers on who car es and can be 
underst andi ngi s essential .
 
 
The Power  of t he G roup
 
 
The pow er of group support  i s somet hing that  cannot be desc ri bed but  has t o be experi enced. A 
l ovi ng and support
i ve group can do w onders t o hel p us more easi ly get i n t ouch w it h our 
deeper feeli ngs. To share your feeli ngs wi t h a group means t here are more people avai l abl e t o 
give you l ove. The pot enti al  for growt h i s magnif i ed by t he si ze of t he group. Even i f you d
o 
not  speak out  i n a group, by l i st eni ng t o ot hers speak openly and honest l y about t hei r feeli ngs, 
your aw areness and insight  expand.
 
 
When I l ead group seminars around t he country I repeat edl y experi ence deeper parts of myself 
t hat need t o be heard and un
derst ood. When someone stands up and shares t hei r feel i ngs, 
 
 
145
 
 
suddenly I begi n t o remem ber somet hing or feel  somet hi ng mysel f. I gain valuable new

Bot h men and w omen have dif fi cul t y aski ng for support . Women, how ever, t end t o fi nd it 
much mo
re fr ust rat i ng and dis appoint i ng t o ask for support  t han men do. For t his  reason, I w ill 
be addressi ng t his chapter  t o w omen. O f course, men wi ll  deepen t heir underst andi ng of 
w omeni ft hey t oo readthis  chapt er.
 
 
WH Y WO MEN  DO N'TA SK
 
 
Women make t he mi st ak
e of t hinki ng t hey don't have t o ask for support . Bec ause 
they 
i ntuit i vel y feel  t he needs of others  and give w hat ever t hey can, t hey mist akenl y expect  men t o 
do t he same. When a woman i s i n l ove, she i nsti ncti vely offers her l ove. Wit h great deli ght and 
en
t husiasm , she l ooks for w ays t o offer her support . The more she l oves someone, t he more 
mot ivated she i s t o offer her l ove. Back on Venus, everyone aut omati call y gi ves support , so 
t here w as no reas on t o ask for it . In fact , not needing t o ask is one of the
 
w ays t hey show  t heir 
l ove for one anot her.O n V enust heir m ot t oi s "Love i s never havi ng t oask! "
 
 
Bec ause t hi s i s her reference poi nt, she ass umes t hat  if her part ner l oves her, he w il l offer hi s 
support and she w on't have t o ask. She may even purposeful
l y 
not ask 
as a t est  t o see i f he 
reall y l oves her. To pass  t he t est , she requi res t hat  he ant ici pat e her needs and offer his 
unsol icit ed support !
 
 
This  approach t o rel ati onships w it h men doesn't  w ork. Men are fr om Mars , and on Mars  i f you 
w ant support  you
 
simpl y have t o ask for it . Men are not  i nst i nct i vel y mot ivated t o offer  t hei r 
support ; t hey need t o be asked. This  can be very confusi ng because i f you ask a man for 
support i n thew rong way he gets t urned off ,and if  you don't  askat  al l you'll  get  li tt l
e or none.
 
 
In t he begi nni ng of a rel ati onshi p, i f a w oman doesn't  get  t he support  she w ants, she t hen 
ass umes t hat  he i s not  gi ving because he has not hing more t o gi ve. She pati ent l y and l ovi ngly 
conti nues t o gi ve ass umi ng t hat sooner or l ater he'll  cat ch
 
up. H e ass umes, however, he i s 
givi ng enough, becauseshe conti nues gi ving tohim .
 
 
H e doesn't  reali ze she is expecti ng him  t o give back. H e t hinks t hat  if she needed or w anted 
more she w oul d st op gi ving. But  si nce she i s fr om V enus, she not  onl y wants mo
re but  al so 
expects him t o off er his support  wi t hout being asked. But  he i s w ait i ng for her t o st art  aski ng 
for s upport  if s hew ant si t . If s hei s not  aski ng for s upport  he assumes he i s giving enough.
 
 
Eventual l y, she may ask for his  support , but  by t his  
t i me she has given so much more and feel s 
so much res ent ment t hat  her request  i s real l y a demand. Some w omen wil l  resent a man si mply 
because t hey have t o ask for his  support . Then, w hen t hey do ask, even i f he says yes and gi ves 
her some support , she w il l
 
sti ll  resent t hat  she had t o ask. She feels "If I have t o ask, it  doesn't  
count ."
 
 
 
 
147
 
 
Men do not res pond w el l  t o demands and resent ment . Even if a man is w il li ng t o give support , 
her resentment or demands wi ll  lead hi m t o say no. Demands are a compl et e t urno
ff . H er 
chances of gett i ng his support  are dram at icall y reduced w hen a request becomes a demand. In 
some cases  he wi ll  evengive l ess  for aw hil e if he senses t hat  shei s demandi ng more.
 
 
This  patt ern makes rel at i onshi ps w it h men very dif fi cul t  for t he una
ware w omen. Though t his 
probl em may feel  i nsurmount abl e, i t can be sol ved. By rememberi ng that men are from Mars 
you can learn new  wayst o ask forw hat youw ant
-
w ayst hatw ork.
 
 
In my semi nars I have t rai ned t housands of women i n t he art  of asking, and t he
y repeat edly 
have had i mm edi at e succ ess . In t his  chapt er w e w i ll  explore t he t hree st eps i nvol ved i n aski ng 
for and gett i ng w hat you w ant . They are: (1) Pract ice aski ng correct l y for w hat you're already 
getti ng; ( 2)  Pract i ce asking for more, even w hen you 
know he wi ll  say no, and accept  hi s no; ( 3) 
Practi ceass erti ve aski ng.
 
 
STEP 1: A SKING  CORR ECTLY FO R
 
WHA T YOU A RE ALREA DY GETTING
 
 
The fi rst  st ep i n learni ng how  t o get more In your relati onshi ps is t o practi ce aski ng for w hat 
you are al ready gett i ng. Bec o
me aw are of w hat your part ner i s al ready doi ng for you. Especi ally 
t he li t tl e t hings, l i ke carr ying boxes, fi xi ng t hings, cl eaning up, making cal ls, and other li tt le 
chores.
 
 
The i mportant part  of this  st age i s t o begi n asking him  t o do t he li t tle t hings h
e al ready does 
and not  t o t ake him for gr anted. Then w hen he does t hose t hi ngs give him  a l ot of appreci ati on. 
Temporari l y gi ve up expect i ng him t o off er hi ssupport  unsol icit ed.
 
 
In st ep 1,i t i si mport antnot  t o askfor m ore t han w hat hei s used to gi vin
g. Focus on aski ng him 
t o do l i tt l e t hings t hat he norm all y does. A l low  him  t o become used t o heari ng you ask for 
t hingsi n a non
-
demandi ng t one.
 
 
When he hears a demanding t one, no mat t er how  nic el y you phras e your request , al l  he hears  is 
t hat he is not  
givi ng enough. This  makes him  feel  unl oved and unappreci at ed. Hi s tendency is 
t hen t o gi vel ess  unt il  you appreci at ew hat  he is al readygivi ng.
 
 
H e may be condit i oned by you ( or his mot her)  imm edi at el y t o say no t o your request s. In st ep I 
you wi l l be rec o
ndi ti oni ng him t o respond posi t i vel y t o your request s. When a man gradual l y 
reali zest hat hei s appreci ated and not taken forgranted andt hat he pl eases  you, he wi ll  want to 
res pond posi ti vely t o your request s w hen he can. Then he wi ll  begi n automati cal l y
 
offeri ng his 
support .But t his advanced st ageshoul dn't  be expect edi n the beginni ng.
 
 
But  t here' s anot her reason t o st art  by aski ng him for w hat he's already givi ng. You need t o be 
sure you're aski ng i n a w ay he can bear you and res pond. That 's what I me
an w hen I say 
"aski ng correct l y."
 
 
Ti ps forMoti vati ng aMan
 
 
There are fi ve secr ets of how  t o correct l y ask a Marti an for support . If  they are not  observed, he 
may be easil y t urned off. They are: appropri ate t i mi ng, non
-
demanding at t it ude, be bri ef, be 
di
rect , and use correct  wording.
 
 
 
 
148
 
 
Let 's l ook at  each more cl osel y:
 
 
1. Appropri ate  Ti mi ng.
 
Be caref ul not  t o ask hi m t o do somet hi ng t hat  he is obviousl y j ust 
planning t o do. For exampl e, i f he is about t o empt y t he t rash, don't say "Coul d you empt y t he 
t ras
h?" H e w il l  feel  you are t el li ng him w hat  t o do. Ti mi ng i s cr uci al . Also i f he i s full y focused 
on somet hing don't  expect  hi mi mmedi at el y t ores pond t o your r equest .
 
 
2. N on
-
dem anding Att i tude. 
R emember, a request  i s not a demand. If you have a resent ful o
r 
demandi ng att it ude, no matt er how carefull y you choose your w ords, he w i ll  feel 
unapprec iat edforw hathe has already gi ven and probabl y say no.
 
 
3. Be Bri ef .
 
A voi d gi ving him  a fist  of reasons w hy he shoul d hel p you. A ssume t hat he doesn't 
have t o be co
nvi nced. The l onger you explai n yoursel f t he more he w i l l  resist , Long 
explanat i ons val i dat i ng your request  make him feel  as t hough you don't t rust  him t o support 
you. Hew il l st art t o feel mani pul at ed i nst ead offr eet o off er his s upport .
 
 
Just as a w oman
 
w ho i s upset  doesn't  w ant t o hear a l ist of reas ons and explanati ons about w hy 
she shoul dn't  be upset , a man doesn't  want t o hear a li st  of reasons and explanat i ons about  w hy 
he should ful fi ll  herrequest .
 
 
Women mi st akenly give a l ist of reasons t o j ust i
fy t hei r needs. They think i t wi ll  hel p hi m see 
t hat her r equest  i s val i d and t herefore mot i vat e him . What a man hears is "This  i s w hy you have 
t o do i t ." The l onger t he l i st , t he more he may resi st  supporti ng you. If  he asks you "w hy?" t hen 
you can give y
our reasons, but  t hen agai n, be cauti ousl y bri ef. Practi ce t rusti ng t hat  he wi ll  do 
i t ,i f hecan. Be as bri efas possi ble.
 
 
4. Be Di rect . 
Women often thi nkt hey are aski ng for s upport w hen t heyare not.When she needs 
support , a w oman maypresent t he prob
l em but not  directl y ask for hi ssupport . She expect s 
him t o off er his s upport and negl ect s di rect ly toask fori t .
 
 
A n indi rect  request  impl i est herequest  but  does not  directl y say i t. These i ndirec t request s 
make aman feel t aken for granted and unappre
ci ated. Occ asi onal l y using i ndi rect st at ement s i s 
cer t ai nlyOK, butw hent hey arerepeat edly used, a man becomes r esi st ant t o gi ving hi s 
support .H emay not even know  w hy he is s o resi st ant . The fol l owi ng stat ement s are al l  
examples ofi ndirect  request san

Yo u sho ul d  tal k wi th me m o re

5. Use Correc t Wording.
 
O ne of t he most common mist akes i n aski n
g for support  i s t he use of 
could and 
can
 
i n place of w oul d and w i ll . "Coul d you empt y t he t rash?" i s mer el y a quest i on 
gatheri ng i nformati on. "Woul d you empt yt he trash?" i sa request .
 
 
Women oft en use "coul d you?" i ndi rectl y t o i mpl y "w oul d you?" As I menti oned before, 
i ndi rect request s are a turnoff . When used occasi onall y t hey cert ai nly may go unnoti ced, but 
persist ent l y usi ng 
can 
and could begi nst o irrit at e men.
 
 
When I suggest  t o w o
men t hat t hey begi n asking for support , someti mes  t hey pani c because 
t heir part ners  have already made comm ent smany times  such as:
 
 
1
 
 
 1ï

o."
 
 
 ï
 
In spi te of how  it  sounds t o a w oman, w hen a man makes t hi s kind of comment , w hat  he real l y 
means i s "I don't  l i ke the w ay you ask! " If a woman doesn't underst and how cert ai n language 
can aff ect  men, she wi ll  get ev
en more snarl ed. She becomes afr ai d t o ask and st art s sayi ng, 
"Coul d you..." because she t hi nks she i s bei ng more pol i te. Though t hi s w orks well  on Venus, i t 
doesn't w ork at  al l  onMars .
 
 
O n Mars it  w oul d he an i nsul t t o ask a man "Can you empt y t he tras h?
" O f course he can empt y 
t he t ras h!  The quest i on i s not  can he empt y t he t ras h but wi ll  he empt y t he t rash. A ft er he has 
been i nsul t ed, he maysay no just  because you have irrit at ed hi m.
 
 
What Men Want  t oBeAsked
 
 
When I explai n t hi s dist i nct i on bet w een t
he c w ords and t he w  w ords i n my semi nars, w omen 
t end t o t hi nk I am making a big deal over not hing. To w omen t here is not  much di ff erence

dif ference. Because t h
is dist i nct i on i s so import ant, I'm i ncl udi ng comment s by seventeen 
dif ferent menw ho att ended my semi nars .
 
 
1. When I am asked "Coul d you cl ean upt he backyard" I r eall y take it  l iterall y. I say, "Icould do 
i t , sure it 's possi bl e." But I am not  sayi ng "I
 
w il l  do it ," and I cert ainly don't feel  li ke I am 
maki ng a promi se t o do i t . O n t he ot her hand, w hen I am asked " Woul d you cl ean up t he 
 
 
150
 
 
backyard" I begi n t o make a decisi on, and I am w il li ng t o be support i ve. If I say yes, the 
chances of m yrem emberi ng t
o do it  aremuch great er because I havemade a promi se.
 
 
2. When she says "I nee
d your hel p. Coul d you pleas e help?" it  sounds cr it i cal , li ke somehow  I 
have already fai l ed her. It doesn't  feel li ke an invi t at i on t o be t he good guy I want t o be and 
support  her. O n t he other hand, "I need your hel p. Woul d you please carr y t hi s? " sounds 
li ke a 
request and an opport unit yt o be t he good guy.I w ant  t osay yes."
 
 
3. When my wi fe says "Can you change Chri st opher' s diaper? " I t hi nk insi de, Sure I can change 
i t . I am capable, and a diaper is a simpl e t hing to change. But  t hen i f I don't feel  l i
ke doi ng it  I 
mi ght make some excuse. N ow , i f she asked "Woul d 
you 
change Chri stopher's diaper? " I w ould 
say "Yeah, sure," and doi t . Insi de Iw oul dfeel , Il i ke to parti ci pateand Ienjoy hel pi ng rai se our 
chi l dren. Iw ant  t o hel p!
 
 
4. When I am asked "Wo
uld you help me please?" i t  gives me an opport uni t y t o help, and I am 
more t hanw il li ng t o support  her, but w hen I hear 
"Coul d you 
hel p me pl ease?''  I f eel  backed up 
against  t he wall , as i f I have no choic e. l f I have t he abili t y t o hel p t hen I am expect ed
 
t o hel p! I 
don't f eel  appreciat ed.
 
 
5. I resent bei ng asked "could you" I feel  l i ke I have no choice but  t o say yes. If  I say no she w i ll 
be upset w it h me. It  i s not a r equest  but  a demand.
 
 
6. I keep mysel f busy, or at  l east  pret end t o be busy so t hat t h
e w oman I w ork wi t h doesn't  ask 
me t he "coul d you" quest i on. Wi t h "w oul d you"I f eel  I havea choi ce, and I w ant  t o hel p.
 
 
7. Just  t hi s l ast  w eek, w i fe asked me, "Coul d you plant  t he fl owers t oday?" and wi t hout 
hesi tati on I sai d yes. Then w hen she: cam e ho
me she asked, "Di d you pl ant t he fl ow er? " I sai d 
no. She sai d, "Coul d you do it  t omorrow?" and again, wi t hout  hesit ati on, I sai d yes. This 
happened every day t his w eek, and the fl ow ers ar e sti ll  not  plant ed. I t hi nk i f s he had asked me 
"Woul d you plant t he
 
flower s t omorr ow ?" I w ould have t hought about i t , and i f I had sai d yes I 
w oul d have done it .
 
 
8. When I say "Yes, I c oul d do t hat " I am not  commi tt i ng myself t o doi ng i t . I am j ust sayi ng t hat 
I could do i t . I have not  promised t o do it . If  she gets  upse
t  w it h me I feel  li ke she doesn't  have 
a ri ght . If I s ayI wi ll  doi t ,t hen Ican underst and w hy shei s upset i f I don't do it .
 
 
9. I grew up w i t h fi ve si st ers , and now  I am marr i ed and have t hree daughter s. When my w ife 
says "Can you bri ng out t he t rash?"
 
I j ust  don't  answ er. Then
 
she asks "w hy?" and I don't even 
know. N ow I r eal i ze w hy. I feel  cont roll ed.I c an res pond t o "w oul d you?"
 
 
10. When I hear a "coul d you" I'l l  i mmediat el y say yes, and t hen over t he next t en mi nut es I w il l 
reali ze w hy I'm not  goi
ng t o do i t  and t hen i gnore t he questi on. But  when I hear a "w i l l  you" a 
part  of me comes up saying "Yes, I w ant  t o be of ser vi ce," and t hen even i f obj ect i ons come up 
l at er i nmy mi nd, Iw il l st il l ful fi ll  herrequest  becauseI have gi ven myw ord.
 
 
11. I 
w il l  say yes t o a "can you," but  i nsi de I resent her. I feel  t hat  i f I say no she w i ll  t hrow  a fit . 
I feel mani pul at ed. When she asks "w oul d you," I feel fr ee t o say yes or no. It  is t hen my choi ce, 
and t hen Iw ant  t osay yes.
 
 
12. When a w oman asks me "Wo
uld you do t hi s?" I feel  ass ured i nsi de that I am goi ng t o get  a 
poi nt f or t hi s.I f eel  apprec i at ed and happy to give.
 
 
 
151
 
 
 
13. When I hear a "w ould you" I feel  I am being t rust ed t o serve. But  w hen I hear a "can you" or 
"could you" I hear a quest i on behi nd t h
e questi on. She i s aski ng me if I can empt y t he t rash 
w hen it  is obvious t hat I could. But  behi nd her quest i on i s t he request , w hic h she doesn't  trust 
me enought o di rectl y ask.
 
 
14. When a w oman asks "w oul d you" or "w i l l  you" I feel  her vul nerabil it y. I a
m much more 
sensit i ve to her and her needs; I defi ni t el y don't w ant t o rej ect  her. When she says "could you" I 
am much more apt  t o say no because I know  i t  i s not  a rej ect i on of her. It  is simpl y an 
i mpersonal st atement  saying I can't  do it . She w on't  take
 
i t  personall y i f I say no t o a "Coul d 
you do thi s?"
 
 
15. For me "w oul d you" makes i t  personal, and I w ant t o give, but  "could you" makes it 
i mpersonal, and Iw il l  gi ve if it  i s conveni ent ori f I  don't  have anyt hi ngel set o do.
 
 
16. When a w oman says "Cou
l d you pleas e help me? " I can feel  her res entm ent  and I w il l  resist 
her, but  i f she says "Woul d you please hel p me" I can't  hear any res entm ent , even i f t here is 
some. I amw il li ng t o say yes.
 
 
17. When a w oman says "Coul d you do t hi s for me?" I get  ki nd o
f honest  and say "I' d rat her 
not ." The l azy part  of me comes out . But  w hen I hear a "Woul d you pl ease? " I become cr eat i ve 
and st art t hinking ofw ays t o hel p.
 
 
O new ay women are s ure t o rel ate t ot he si gnifi cant diff erence bet w eenw oul d andcouldi st o

H i sheart  i s full , li ket he moon shi ni ng above. Kneeli ng before her, hereaches out  t o hol d her 
hands. Then he gazes up int o her eyesand gentl y says, "Coul d you marry me
?"
 
 
Im medi at el y t he romance i s gone. Usi ng t he c w ord he appears  w eak and unw ort hy. In t hat 
moment , he reeks of i nsecurit y and l ow  self
-

t hen bot h hi s st rengt h and vul nerabi li t y are present . That  i s t hew ayt

Sim il arl y, a man requi res t hat  a w oman propose her requests i n t his manner. U se t he w w ords. 
The c w ords s oundt oount rust i ng,i ndirec t, w eak, and mani pul at i ve.
 
 
When she says "Coul d you empty t he tras h?" the message he recei ves i s "If you 
can 
empt y it 
t hen you shoul d do i t . I w oul d do i t  for you!" From his poi nt  of view  he feels i t  i s obvi ous t hat

for gr ant ed.H e doesn't feel  mi st ed to be t here f or

I rem ember one w oman i n a semi nar expl ai ni ng t he differ ence i n Venusi an t erms . She sai d, "A t

To ask a manforsupport :
 
 
1. Be direct .
 
 
2. Be bri ef.
 
 
3. U se "w oul d you" or "wil l  you" phrases .
 
 
It 's best  not  t o be t oo indi rect , t oo l engt hy, or t o empl oy phrases  such as "could you" or "can

CommonQ uesti onsA bout  Aski ngfor Support
 
 
This  fi rst  st ep can be diff i cul t . H ere are some common quest i ons, w hich give cl ues
 
t o bot h t he 
obj ecti ons and t heresi stance t hat w omenmay have.
 
 
1. Q uest i on. A  w oman mi ght feel , "Why should I have t o ask him w hen I don't require him to 
ask me?"
 
 
A nsw er: R emem ber, men are fr om Mars ; t hey are differ ent . By acc epti ng and w orking wi t h his
 
dif ferences you wi ll  get w hat you need. If, i nstead, you t ry t o change him  he w il l  st ubbornl y 
res ist . A lt hough aski ng for w hat  you w ant  i s not  sec ond nat ure t o Venusi ans, you can do it 
w it hout gi ving up w ho you are. When he feel s loved and appreci at ed he 
w il l  graduall y become 
morew il li ng t o off er his s upport  wi t hout  being asked. Thati s a l at erst age.
 
 
2. Q uest i on. A  w oman may feel , "Why shoul d I apprec i at e w hat  he does w hen I am doi ng 
more? "
 
 
A nsw er: Mart i ans gi ve l ess w hen t hey do no
t  feel  appreci at ed. If you w ant him t o give more, 
t hen w hat  he needs i s more appreci ati on. Men are mot ivated by appreci ati on. If  you are gi ving 
more it  may, of cours e, be hard t o appreci at e him. Grac eful l y begin t o give l ess  so t hat you can 
apprec iat e hi m 
more. By maki ng t his change, not onl y are you support ing him  i n feel i ng l oved, 
but  you wi ll  also get  t he support  you need and deser ve.
 
 
3. Q uest i on. A  w oman may feel , "If  I have t o ask him  for support , he may t hink he i s doi ng me 
a favor."
 
 
A nsw er: Thi s i s
 
how  he shoul d feel . A  gi ft  of l ove i s a favor. When a man feels he i s doi ng you 
a favor, he i s t hen givi ng fr om his  heart . R emember, he's a Marti an and doesn't  keep sc ore t he 
w ay you do. If he feel s t hat you are t el li ng him he i s obli gated t o gi ve, his  he
art cl oses  and he 
givesl ess .
 
 
4. Q uest i on. A  w oman may feel , "If  he l oves me he shoul d j ust  offer his  support, I shoul dn't 
have t o ask."
 
 
A nsw er: Remember men are fr om Mars ; t hey are dif ferent . Men w ai t t o be asked. Inst ead of 
t hinking, "If he l oves me he
 
wi l l offer his support , consi der t hi s t hought, If he w ere a V enusi an 
he w oul d offer  his support , but  he's not , he's a Marti an. By acc ept i ng this  differ ence, he wi ll  be 
much morew il l i ng tosupport  you, and gradual ly he w il l  begint o offerhis  support ."
 
 
5
. Q uesti on. A  woman may feel , "If I have t o ask for t hi ngs he wi ll  think I am not  giving as 
much as he i s. I am afraid
-
he mayfeel  li ke he doesn't  have t o gi veme more! "
 
 
A nsw er: A  man i s more generous w hen he feel s as t hough he doesn't  have t o gi ve. In ad
di ti on, 
w hen a man hears a w oman aski ng for support  ( i n a respect ful  w ay) , what he also hears i s t hat 
she feel s enti tl ed t o t hat support. H e does not assume she has gi ven l ess. Q ui t e t he contrar y, he 
ass umes she must  be giving more or at l east as much as h
e i s, and t hat  is w hy she feel s good 
 
 
154
 
 
about as ki ng.
 
 
6. Q uest i on. A w oman may feel , "When I ask for support , I am afr aid t o be bri ef. I w ant t o 
explai n w hyI need hi shelp. I don't w antt o appear demandi ng. "
 
 
A nsw er: When a man hears a request fr om hi s par
t ner, he t rust s she has good reasons for 
aski ng. If  she gives him a l ot of reasons w hy he should ful fi l l her request , he feels as t hough he 
can't  say no, and i f he can't say no t hen he feel s mani pul at ed or t aken for grant ed. Let him give 
you a gi ft  i nst ead
 
of t aking his  support for granted.
 
 
If  he needs t o underst and more he w il l  ask w hy. Then i t  is OK t o gi ve reas ons. Even w hen he 
asks, be car eful  not  t o be t oo l engt hy. Gi ve one, or at most , t w o reas ons. If  he sti ll  needs more 
i nformati on, he'l l l et  you kn
ow.
 
 
STEP 2: PRA CTICEA SKI NG  FO R MOR E
 
( EV EN  WH EN  YOU KNO WH EMA Y SA Y NO)
 
 
Bef ore at t empti ng t o ask a man for more, make sure he feels appreci at ed for w hat he i s already 
givi ng. By conti nui ng t o ask for hi s support  w ithout expecti ng hi m t o do more t han he has been 
doi ng hew i ll  feel  not  only appreci at ed butal so acc ept ed.
 
 
When h
e i s used t o heari ng you ask for his  support  wi t hout w anti ng more, he feel s l oved in 
your presence. H e feel s he doesn't  have t o change t o get  your l ove. At  t hi s poi nt he wi ll  be 
w il li ng t o change and st retch his abil it y t o support  you. A t  t his poi nt  you ca
n risk aski ng for 
morew it hout gi ving him t hemessage that hei s not  good enough.
 
 
The sec ond st ep of t hi s process  is t o l et  him  real i ze t hat he can say no and st i ll  rec ei ve your 
l ove. When he feel s t hat he can say no w hen you ask for more, he w il l feel  fr
ee t o say yes or no. 
Keep i nmi ndt hat  menare m uch more wi ll i ngto say yesi ft hey havet he fr eedom t osay no.
 
 
It 's i mport ant  t hat w omen l earn bot h how t o ask and how t o acc ept  no for an answ er. Women 
usuall y i ntui ti vel y feet  w hat t heir part ner's respons
e wi ll  be even before t hey ask. If t hey sense 
t hat he w il l  resi st  t hei r request, t hey w on't  even bot her aski ng. Inst ead, t hey w il l  feel  rej ect ed. 
H e, ofcourse, wi ll  haveno i deaw hat happened 
-
 
all  t hi s has gone oni nher head.
 
 
In step 2, pract i ce aski ng
 
for support i n all  t hose si t uat i ons w here you w oul d w ant  t o ask but 
don't because you feel his  resi st ance. G o ahead and ask for support even i f you sense his 
res ist ance; eveni f you know  hew il l  say no.
 
 
For exampl e, a w i fe might  say t o her husband, w ho i
s focused on w atchi ng t he new s, "Woul d 
you go t o t he grocery store and pi ck up some sal mon for di nner?" When she asks t his quest i on, 
she is al ready prepared for hi m t o say no. H e is probably compl et el y surpri sed because she has 
never i nterrupted him w it h a
 
request  l i ke t hi s before. H e wi ll  probably make some excuse l i ke 
"I am  ri ght i n the mi ddle of w at chi ng t he news.Can't you do it ?"
 
 
She may feel  li ke sayi ng "Sure I could do i t . But I am alw ays doi ng everythi ng around here. I 
don't li ke bei ng your servant
.I w ant  some hel p!"
 
 
When you ask and sense you w i l l  get  a rej ect i on, prepare yoursel f for the no and have a ready 
answ er l i ke "O K." If  you w ant t o be reall y Marti an i n your res ponse, you could say "no 
probl em"
-
t hat  w oul d be music t o hi s ears .A  si mple "O
K"i s fi ne, how ever.
 
 
 
155
 
 
 
It  is import ant t o ask and t hen act  as if it  is perf ect l y O K for hi m t o say no. R emem ber, you're 
maki ng it  saf e for him  to ref use. Use t hi s approach onl y for sit uat i ons that are real l y O K if he 
says no. Pi ck si t uat i ons w here you woul d
 
appreci ate his  support  but  rarel y ask fori t . Makesure 
you wil l feel comfortable i f hesays no.

In each of t he above exampl es, be prepared for him  t o say no and practi ce being accepti ng and

man for s
upport  and he i sn't  made w rong for sayi ng no, he gives you betw een fi ve and t en 
poi nts . N ext  t ime you ask he w il l  be more responsi ve t o your request . In a sense, by aski ng for 
his  support i n a lovi ngw ay, you are hel pi ng him s tretch his abil it y to gi ve mor

I fi rst  l earned t hi s fr om a w oman empl oyee years ago. We w ere w orki ng on a non

profi t  proj ect 
and needed vol unt eers. She w as about  t o call  Tom, w ho w as a fri end of mi ne. I t ol d her not  t o 
bot her because I already knew he w oul d not be able t o help t hi s 
t ime. She sai d she w oul d call  
anyw ay. I asked her why, and she sai d, "When I call  I w il l  ask for hi s support , and w hen he 
says no I wi ll  be very graci ous and unders tanding. Then next  ti me, w hen I call  for a fut ure 
project , he w il l be more w il li ng t o say ye
s. H e w il l  have a posit i ve memory of me." She w as 
ri ght .
 
 
When you ask a man for support  and you do not  rej ect him for sayi ng no, he wi ll  remem ber

t hat, and next ti me he w il l be much more w ill i ng t o give. O n t he other hand, if you qui et ly 
sac ri fice your ne

could he know  if you don't as k?
 
 
A s you gent l y cont i nue t o ask for more, occ asional l y your part ner wi ll  be able t o st ret ch his

For exampl e, I remember st andi ng i n t he kitchen wi t h a fami l y friend one day w hen our 
daught er Lauren was five years old. She asked me t o li ft  her up and do t ri cks, and I sai d, "N o, I 
can't t oday. Iamreal t ired."
 
 
She persi st ed, aski ng playfull y, "Please
, Daddy,pleas e, Daddy, j ust  onefl i p."
 
 
The fr i end sai d, "N ow , Lauren, your fat her is t ired. H e has w orked hard t oday. You shoul dn't 
ask."
 
 
Laureni mmedi at el y responded by saying, "I am j ust aski ng! "
 
 
"But  you know your father l oves you," my fri end sai d. 
"H e can't  say no to you."
 
 
( The tr ut h is, if he can't say no, t hat 's hi s problem, not hers .)
 
 
Im medi at el ymyw i fe and al l t hree daughters  sai d, "O h yes he can! "
 
 
I w as proud of my famil y. It  has t aken a l ot of w ork, but  graduall y w e have learned t o ask for
 
support  andal so t o acc ept no.
 
 
STEP 3: PRA CTICEA SSER TIV EA SKIN G
 
 
O nce you have pract iced st ep 2 and you can graci ousl y acc ept  a no, you are ready for step 3. In 
t his step you ass ert  your full  pow er t o get w hat  you w ant. You ask for his  support , and i f h
e 
st art s maki ng excuses and res i st s your request , you don't say "O K" as i n st ep 2. Instead you 
practi cemaki ng it  OK that he resist s but  cont i nue wai t i ng for hi mt o say yes.
 
 
Inst ead of immediat el y l ett i ng hi m off  t he hook by sayi ng "O K," say nothi ng. St an
d t here and 
acc ept t hat he i s resi sting your request . By not res ist i ng his  res ist ance t here is a much great er 
chance hew il l say yes.
 
 
Str etchi ng i s anot her way t o underst and a man's resi stance t o your request s. Whenever you ask 
for more, he has t o st retch
 
hims el f. If  he i s not  in shape, he can't do i t . That is w hy you have t o 
prepare amanfor st ep 3 by movingt hroughst eps 1 and 2.
 
 
In addit i on, you know  t hat i t i s more diffi cult  t o st ret ch i n t he morni ng. Lat er i n t he day you 
can stretch much fart her and easi er. When a man grumbles, j ust imagi ne t hat he is st ret chi ng i n 
 
 
157
 
 
t he morni ng.O nce he has f i ni shedst ret chi ng he w il l feel great .
 
H e j ust needs t o grumbl e fi rst .
 
 
The art  of ass erti ve aski ng i s t o remai n sil ent aft er you have made a request. Aft er you have 
asked, expect  him t o moan, groan, scow l , grow l, mumble, and grumbl e. I cal l  t he resi stance men 
have t o res pondi ng t o request s t h
e grumbl es. The more focused a man i s at  t he ti me, t he more 
he w il l  grumbl e. H is grumbles have not hing t o do w it h his wi ll i ngness t o support ; t hey are a 
sympt om of how  focused he i s at  t he ti mew henasked.
 
 
A  w oman wi ll  generally misi nterpret  a man's grumb
les. She mi st akenly assumes t hat  he i s 
unw il li ng t o ful fi ll  her request. This  i s not  t he cas e. H is grumbl es are a si gn t hat he i s i n the 
process  of consi deri ng her request . If  he w as not consi deri ng her request  t hen he w oul d very 
cal ml y say no. When a man 
grumbl es i t is a good si gn
- --
he i s tryi ng t o consi der your request 
versus hi s needs.
 
 
H e w i ll  go t hrough i nternal  resist ance at shifting his  direct i on fr om what he's focusi ng on t o 
your request . Li ke opening a door wi t h rust y hinges, t he man wi ll  make unus
ual noi ses. By 
i gnori ng hi s grumbl esthey qui ckl y go aw ay.
 
 
O ften w hen a man grumbl es he i s i n t he process  of sayi ng yes t o your request . Bec ause most 
w omen misunderst and t his  react i on, t hey ei t her avoi d aski ng him for support  or t hey t ake it 
personall y an
drej ect  him i n ret urn.
 
 
In our exampl e, w here he i s headed for bed and you ask him  t o go t o t he st ore for mil k, he is 
l i kel y to grumbl e.
 
 
Let 's say he is on his  way t o bed, and you ask him  t o go t o t he st ore. In his  res ponse, he says 
"O h, I'm reall y t ired
, I w ant t o go t o bed." You repl y wi t h "I made you dinner, I w ashed t he 
dis hes, I got t he kids r eady for bed, and all  you di d was  plant  yoursel f on thi s c ouch!  I don't  ask 
for much, but at l east  you could hel p now . I am so exhaust ed. I feel  l i ke I do every
t hing around 
here."
 
 
The argument  st art s. On t he other hand, i f you know t hat  grumbles are j ust  grumbl es and are 
oft en hi s w ay of st arti ng t o say yes, your res ponse wi ll  be si lence. Your sil ence i s a signal  t hat 
you tr ust  t hat  hei s st retchi ng i nsi deand a
boutto say yes.
 
 
.I' mt i red," he says wi t han annoyed l ook. "Iw ant  t o got o bed."
 
 
If  you mi sunders tand his r esponse as  a rej ecti on, you mi ght  say

eal l y hurts m yfeelings.

 õ
 
 
Et c., etc., et c. You get  t he i dea. When
 
he grumbles, she feel s t he urge t o defend her request  and 
mi st akenl y breaks her si l ence. She argues wi t h her part ner i n an at t empt t o convi nce him  t hat 
 
 
158
 
 
he shoul d do i t . Whet her he does i t or not , he wi l l be more resist ant  next  t ime she asks for his 
suppor
t.
 
 
To give him a chance t o ful fi ll  your request s, ask and pause. Let him grumble and say t hings, 
j ust li sten. Eventual l y he wi ll  say yes. Don't mist akenl y bel i eve t hat  he w il l hol d t hi s against 
you. H e can't  and w on't hol d i t agai nst you as long as you do
n't  i nsist or argue w it h him. Even 
i f he wal ks off grumbling, he w il l l et  go of i t , if bot h of you feel  i t is hi s choic e t o do or not  to 
do i t .
 
 
Someti mes, how ever, he may not  say yes. Or he may t ry t o argue his w ay out  by aski ng you  
some quest i ons. Be car
eful . Duri ng your pausehe may ask quest i onsl ike:
 
 
* "Why can't  you do it ?"
 
 
* "I real l y don't  havet ime. Woul d you doi t?"
 
 
* "I am busy, I don't  have t ime. What  are you doing?"
 
 
Someti mes t hese are j ust  rhet ori cal  quest i ons. So you can rem ai n qui et . Don
't  speak unless  it  is 
cl ear t hat he i s reall y l ooki ng for an answer. If  he w ants  an answ er, give him  one, but  be very 
bri ef, and t hen ask again. A sserti ve aski ng means aski ng wi t h a sense of confi dence and t rust 
t hat hewi l l support  you i f hecan.
 
 
If  he q

Programmi ng a Mant oSay Yes
 
 
I fi rst  becam e consci ous of t his proces s w hen my wi fe asked me t o buy some mi l k at t he st ore 
w hen I w as on my way to bed. I rem ember grumbli ng out  l oud. Inst ead of 
arguing wi t hme, s he 
j ust  l i st ened, ass umi ng t hat event uall y I w oul d do i t . Then fi nal l y I made a few  bangi ng noi ses 
on my w ay out , got  i nmy car, andw ent  t ot he store.
 
 
Then somet hi ng happened, somet hi ng t hat  happens t o al l  men, somet hing t hat  w omen don'
t 
know about. As I now moved cl oser t o my new  goal , t he mi l k, my grumbles w ent aw ay. I 
st art ed feel i ng my l ove for my wi fe and my wi l li ngness t o support . I st art ed feel i ng l i ke t he 
good guy. Beli eveme,Il i kedt hatfeel i ng.
 
 
By t he t ime I was i n t he st ore
, I w as happy t o be gett i ng t he mil k. When my hand reac hed t he 
bot t le, I had achi eved my new goal . A chievement  al w ays makes men feel  good. I pl ayful ly 
pic ked up t he bot tl e i n my ri ght hand and t urned around wi t h a l ook of pri de t hat  sai d "H ey. 
l ook at  me. 
I'm  gett i ng t he mi l k for my wi fe. I go t o t he st ore and get some mil k. I am one of 
t hose great  generous guys. What a guy."
 
 
When I ret urned wi t h the mi l k, she w as happy t o see me. She gave me a big hug and sai d, 
"Thank you so much.I'm s o gl ad I di dn't  hav
e to get  dress ed."
 
 
If  she had i gnored me, I probably w oul d have resent ed her. N ext  t ime she asked me t o buy t he 
mi l k I w oul d have probably grumbl ed even more. But  she di dn't  i gnore me, she gave me l ot s of 
l ove.
 
 
I w at ched my react i on and heard mysel f t hin
k, What a w onderf ul  w i fe I have. Even after I was 
 
 
159
 
 
so resi stant and grumbly she is sti ll  appreci at i ng me.
 
 
The next ti me she asked me t o buy t he mi l k, I grumbl ed l ess. When I ret urned she w as again 
apprec iati ve. Thet hir dti me, aut omati call y Isaid, "Sure."
 
 
Then a w eek l at er, I noti ced t hat  she w as l ow  on mi l k. I off ered t o get it . She sai d she was 
al ready goi ng t o t he st ore. To my surpri se a part  of me w as disappoi nted! I w anted t o get  t he 
mi l k. Her l ove had program med me t o say yes. Even t o t hi s day w hene
ver she asks me t o go t o 
t he st ore and get mil k apart  ofme happi l ysaysyes.
 
 
I personall y experi enced t his  i nner t ransf ormati on. H er acc ept ance of my grumbles and 
apprec iati on of me w hen I ret urned heal ed my resi stance. From t hat  t ime on, as she pract i c

WH Y MEN AR E SO  SEN SITIV E
 
 
You may be aski ng yours
elf w hy men are so sensi ti ve about being asked for support . It is not 
because men are lazy but because men have so much need t o feel accepted. A ny request  t o be 
more or t o gi ve more might  i nst ead gi vet he message t hat  hei s not  accept ed just t he way he is.
 
 
Just  as a w oman is more sensi ti ve about being heard and feel i ng underst ood w hen she is 
shari ng her feel i ngs, a man i s more sensit i ve about being accepted just  t he w ay he is. A ny 
at t empt  t o improve hi m makes hi m feel  as t hough you are tryi ng t o change him
 
because he is 
not  good enough.
 
 
O n Mars , t he mott o i s "Don't  fi x it  unl ess  it  i s broken." When a man feel s a w oman w ant i ng 
more, and t hat she i s t rying t o change him, he rec ei ves t he mess age t hat  she feel s he i s broken; 
natural l y he doesn't  feel l oved jus
t t hew ay hei s.
 
 
By l earni ng t he art  of aski ng for support , your rel at i onshi ps wi ll  gradual l y become great ly 
enri ched. A s you are able t o recei ve more of t he l ove and support  you need, your part ner will

The probl em is t hat  repres sed feeli ngs don't come up sayi ng "Hi , I am your unres olved feeli ngs

By understandi ng how  past  unresol ved feeli ngs peri odi call y surfac e, it  i s easy t o underst and 
w hy w e can become so easil y hurt  by our part ners . When w e are upset , about 90 percent  of t he 
upset  i
s rel at ed t o our past  and has not hi ng t o do w i t h what  w e t hi nk i s upsetti ng us. G eneral ly 
onl y about  10 percent  of our upset i sappropri ate t o the pres ent  experi ence.
 
 
Let 's l ook at  an example. If our part ner seems a li tt l e cri ti cal  of us, i t may hurt our 
feel i ngs a 
l i tt le. But  because w e are adul ts w e are capable of underst andi ng t hat t hey don't mean t o be 
cr it i cal or maybe we see t hat  t hey had a bad day. This underst andi ng prevent s t heir crit i ci sm 
fr om bei ng too hurtful .We don'tt akei t  pers onal l y.
 
 
But  
on anot her day t hei r cr it i ci sm i s very painful. O n t hi s other day our w ounded feel i ngs from 
t he past  are on t heir  way up. A s a res ult  w e are more vul nerable t o our part ner's cri ti cism . It 
hurt s a l ot  because as a chi l d w e w ere crit i ci zed severel y. O ur part
ner's cri ti ci sm  hurts more 
becausei t t riggers our past  hurt  asw el l .
 
 
A s a chi l d w e w ere not able t o underst and t hat w e w ere i nnocent and t hat  our parents' 
negat i vi t y w as t heir problem. In chi l dhood w e t ake all  cri ti cism , rej ect i on, and blame 
personall y.
 
 
When t hese unres ol ved feeli ngs fr om chi l dhood are comi ng up, w e easi l y i nterpret  our 
part ner's c omm ent s as cri ti ci sm ,rejecti on, and bl ame.H avi ng adul t  di scussi onsat t heset imes is 
hard. Ever yt hing is mi sunderst ood. When our part ner seems crit i cal , 10 p
ercent of our react i on 
rel at est o thei r eff ect  onus and 90 perc ent rel at es t o our past .
 
 
Im agi ne someone poking your arm a l it tl e or gent l y bumpi ng i nto you. It doesn't  hurt a l ot. 
N ow imagi ne you have an open w ound or sore and someone starts poking at  i t

you. It  hurt s much more. In t he same w ay, i f unres olved feel i ngs are comi ng up, w e w il l  be 
overl y sensit i ve t ot he normal pokes and bumps of relati ng.
 
 
In t he begi nni ng of a relat i onshi p we may not  be as sensi t ive. It  t akes t ime for our past
 
feel i ngs 
t o come up. But  w hen t hey do come up, w e react  di ffer ent l y t o our part ners . In most

Wh

This  i nsi ght  helps you to contr ol your feeli ngs w hen t hey come up. If  you are upset  wi t h your

N ever t el l  your part ner, w hen i t  appears  as t hough t he

TH E DELA YED REA CTION  RESPON SE
 
 
Just as l ove may bri ng up our past unresol ved feel i ngs, so does gett i ng w hat  you w ant . 
I 
rem ember w hen I first  learned about t his . Many years ago I had w ant ed sex fr om my part ner, 
but  she w asn't i n t he mood. In my mi nd I accepted t hat . The next  day I hint ed around, and she 
st il l w as not i nterested.This  patt ernconti nuedevery day.
 
 
By t he e
nd of tw o w eeks I was begi nni ng t o feel  resentf ul . But  at  t hat  t i me i n my li fe I didn't 
know how  t o communicat e feel i ngs. Inst ead of t al king about my feel ings and my fr ust rat i on I 
j ust kept pret endi ng as i f everyt hing w ere OK. I w as st uff i ng my negati ve fe
eli ngs and t ryi ng 
t o be l ovi ng. Fort w o w eeks my resent ment  cont inued to buil d.
 
 
I did everythi ng I knew  t o pl ease her and make her happy, w hile i nsi de I w as res ent i ng her 
rej ect i on of me. At  t he end of t w o w eeks I went out  and bought her a pret t y night gow
n. I 
brought  it  home and that eveni ng I gave i t  to her. She opened t he box and w as happil y 
surprised. Iasked her t o t ry it  on. Shesai dshewasn't i n themood.
 
 
A t  t his poi nt  I gave up. I j ust  forgot about sex. I buri ed mysel f i n w ork and gave up my desi r
e 
for sex. In my mi nd I made it  O K by suppressing my feeli ngs of resentment . A bout  tw o w eeks 
l at er, how ever, w hen I came home from w ork, she had prepared a romanti c meal  and w as 
w eari ng t he ni ght gow n I had bought  her tw o weeks before. The li ghts w ere l ow  a
nd soft  music 
w as oni n the background.
 
 
You can imagi ne my react i on. A l l of a sudden I fel t  a surge of resentment . Insi de I fel t  "N ow 
you suff er for four weeks." A ll  of t he resentment t hat  I had suppres sed for t he l ast  four w eeks 
suddenly w as comi ng up. A
ft er t al ki ng about  these feel i ngs I reali zed t hat her w il li ngness to 
give me w hat  Iw ant ed rel eased my ol d resentments .
 
 
When Couples  Suddenly Feel  Their R esentment
 
 
I began t o see t hi s pat t ern i n many ot her sit uations. In my counseli ng prac ti ce, I also ob
ser ved 
t his phenomenon. When one part ner was fi nall y w i ll i ng t o make a change for t he bet t er, t he 
otherw oul d becomesuddenly i ndi ff erent andunapprec iati ve.

A s soon as Bil l  was wil l i ng t o give Mary w hat  she had been aski ng for, she w oul d have a 
res entful
 
react i onl i ke "Wel l, it  i st ool at e" or "So w hat."
 
 
R epeat edly I have counsel ed coupl es w ho have been mar ri ed for over tw ent y years . Their 
chi l dren have grow n up and l eft  home. Suddenl y t he w oman w ants  a di vorc e. The man w akes 
up and reali zes t hat  he w ant
s t o change and get help. As he starts t o make changes and give her 
t he love she has beenwanti ngfor tw ent y years ,she react sw it h col d resentm ent .
 
 
It  is as t hough shew ants hi mt o suff er fort wenty years j ust as 
 
she did. Fort unat el yt hat  i s not

feeli ngs and he hears and unders tands how  shehas been

a manw ants t ol eave and the w oman becomesw il li ng t ochange, but  he resi st

The Cri sis ofR isi ngExpect at i ons

This  i s anot her exampl e of repressed feel i ngs surfaci ng. When t he mi nori ti es felt  more

WH YH E
A LTH Y PEO PLE  MA YN EE D CO UN SEL IN G
 
 
A s you grow  more i nt imat e i n your rel ati onships, l ove i ncreas es. As a res ul t , deeper, more 
painful feeli ngs wi ll  come up t hat  need to be heal ed 
deep feel i ngs li ke shame and fear . Because 
w e generall y do
 
not  know how t o de
al wi t h these pai nful  feel i ngs, w e become st uck.
 
 
To heal t hem w e need to share t hem, but we are t oo afr ai d or ashamed t o reveal w hat  w e are 
feeli ng. At  such t imes w e may become depres sed, anxi ous, bored, res entf ul , or simply 
exhaust ed for no apparent reas
on at  al l . These are al l  sympt oms  of our "st uff" comi ng up and 
being bl ocked.
 
 
Insti ncti vel y you w i ll  want t o eit her run away from l ove or i ncreas e your addi cti ons. This i s t he 
t i me t o w ork on your feel i ngs and not  run away. When deep feel i ngs come up you 
w oul d be 
very wi set o get  t he hel p of a t herapist .
 
 
When deep feeli ngs come up, w e proj ect  our feel i ngs ont o our part ner. I f w e did not  feel  safe to 
express our f eeli ngs t o our parent s or a past partner, all  of a sudden we cannot get  i n t ouch wi th 
our f eel
i ngs i n the presence of our 
present 
part ner. A t t his  poi nt, no mat ter how s upport i ve your 
part ner i s,w hen youare w it h your part ner youw il l  not  feel  safe. Feel i ngs wi ll  be bl ocked.
 
 
It  i s a paradox: because you feel  saf e wi t h your part ner, your deepest  f
ears  have a chance to 
surf ace. When t hey surface you become afrai d and are unable t o share w hat you feel . Your fear 
may evenmake you numb. Whent his
 
happenst he feel i ngs t hat  are comi ng up getst uck.
 
 
 
167
 
 
 
This  i s w hen havi ng a counsel or or t herapist i s t remen
dousl y hel pful. When you are w it h 
someone you are not  projec ti ng your fears  on, you can process  t he feeli ngs t hat  are comi ng up. 
But  if you are onl yw it hyour part ner, youmay feel  numb.
 
 
This  i s w hy peopl e wit h even very l ovi ng relat i onshi ps may i nevi tabl
y need t he hel p of a 
t herapi st . Shari ng i n support  groups al so has t hi s li berat i ng eff ect . Bei ng w i t h ot hers w hom w e 
don't know i nt imat el y but  w ho are support i ve cr eates an opening for our w ounded feel i ngs t o 
be shared.
 
 
When our unres ol ved feeli ngs are be
i ng proj ected on our i nt imat e part ner, he or she is 
pow erl ess t o help us. A ll  our part ner can do i s encourage us t o get  support . U nders tandi ng how 
our past  cont i nues t o affec t  our relat i onshi ps frees us t o acc ept  t he ebb and fl ow of l ove. We 
begi n t o trust
 
l ove and it s heal i ng process . To keep t he magi c of l ove ali ve w e must be fl exi ble 
and adapt t o the ongoing changingseas ons ofl ove.

Fai l i ng i n l ove i s li ke spri ngt ime. We feel  as t hough w e w il l  be happy forever . We cannot

The Summer ofLove
 
 
Throughout  t he summer of our l ove w e reali ze our part ner i s not  as perfec t  as w e t hought, and 
w e have t o w ork on our rel at i
onshi p. N ot onl y is our part ner fr om another planet , but  he or she 
i s also a humanw ho makes mi st akes andi s fl awed in cert ai n ways.
 
 
Frust rat i on and disappoint ment arise; w eeds need t o be uprooted and plant s need extra 
w at eri ng under t he hot sun. It  is no
 
l onger easy t o gi ve l ove and get t he l ove w e need. We 
dis cover t hat  w e are not  al w ays happy, and we do not  alw ays feel  l ovi ng. It  i s not  our pict ure of 
l ove.
 
Many coupl es at t hi s poi nt become di sil l usi oned. They do not w ant  t o w ork on a rel ati onshi p. 
They
 
unreali sti cal l y expect  It  t o be spri ng all  t he t ime. They blame t heir part ners  and gi ve up. 
They do not  real i ze t hat l ove i s not  alw ays easy; someti mes i t  requi res  hard w ork under a hot

But  I caut i on you t o remem ber t hat  l ove i s seasonal. In spri ng It  i s easy, but  i n summer i t  is 
hard w ork. In aut umn you may feel  very generous and fulfil l ed, but i n wi nter you wi ll  feel

easil y forgot ten. The love you feel i n fall  i seasi ly lost In wi nter.
 
 
In t he summer of l ove, w hen t hings get  di ffi cult  and you are not  gett i ng t he l ove you need, 
qui t e suddenly you may forget  
everyt hing you have l earned i n t his  book. In an i nst ant i t  i s all

When t he empti ness of wi nter sets i n, you may feel  hopel ess. You may bl ame yourself and 
forget  how  t o l ove 
and nurt ure yourself. You may doubt  yoursel f and your part ner. You may 
become cyni cal  and feel l i ke givi ng up. This  is al l  a part  of t he cycl e. It  is al w ays darkest  before
