What People Are Saying About NVC
TM
:
ÒNonviolent Communication is a simple yet powerful methodology for
communicating in a way that meets both partiesÕ needs. This is one of

the most useful books you will ever read.Ó
ÑWILLIAM URY, 
co-author of 
Getting to Yes
and author of 
The Third Side
ÒMarshall RosenbergÕs book, 
Nonviolent Communication: A Language
of Life
, is essential reading for anyone who wants to improve their
communication skills. Applying the concepts within the book will

help guide the reader towards a more loving, compassionate, and

nonviolent way of understanding and functioning with others, and

foster more compassion in the world. I highly recommend this book.Ó
ÑMARIANNE WILLIAMSON, 
author of 
Everyday Grace
, 
President Global Renaissance Alliance
ÒThe extraordinary language of Nonviolent Communication is
changing how parents relate to children, teachers to students, and

how we all relate to each other and even to ourselves. It is precise,

disciplined, and enormously compassionate. Most important, once

we study NVC we canÕt ignore the potential for transformation that

lies in any relationship difficultÑif we only bother to communicate

with skill and empathy.Ó
ÑBERNIE GLASSMAN, 
President and 
Co-Founder Peacemaker Community
ÒNonviolent Communication is a powerful tool for peace and partnership.
It shows us how to listen empathically and also communicate our

authentic feelings and needs. Marshall Rosenberg has a genius for

developing and teaching practical skills urgently needed for a less

violent, more caring world.Ó
ÑRIANE EISLER, 
author of 
The Chalice and The Blade
, 
TomorrowÕs Children
, and 
The Power of Partnership
ÒWe learned to speak but not communicate and that has led to so
much unnecessary personal and social misery. In this book you will

find an amazingly effective language for saying whatÕs on your mind

and in your heart. Like so many essential and elegant systems, itÕs

simple on the surface, challenging to use in the heat of the moment

and powerful in its results.Ó
ÑVICKI ROBIN, 
co-author of 
Your Money or Your Life
ÒMarshall Rosenberg provides us with the most effective tools to
foster health and relationships. Nonviolent Communication connects

soul to soul, creating a lot of healing. It is the missing element in what

we do.Ó
ÑDEEPAK CHOPRA,
author of 
Ageless Body, Timeless Mind
ÒI believe the principles and techniques in this book can literally
change the world, but more importantly, they can change the quality

of your life with your spouse, your children, your neighbors, your co-

workers and everyone else you interact with. I cannot recommend it

highly enough.Ó
ÑJACK CANFIELD, 
Chicken Soup for the Soul
series
ÒMarshall Rosenberg's dynamic communication techniques transform
potential conflicts into peaceful dialogues. You'll learn simple tools to

defuse arguments and create compassionate connections with your

family, friends, and other acquaintances. I highly recommend this book.Ó
ÑJOHN GRAY, PH.D., author of 
Men are 
From Mars, Women are from Venus 
ÒRosenberg starts with the question: What happens to disconnect us
from our compassion, leading us to behave violently and exploitively?

Rosenberg makes some challenging points: that compliments and

apologies operate in a system of oppression; that rewards are as

harmful as punishment, that killing is the easy way out. His distinction

between punitive and protective forceÑand how to discern when force

is necessaryÑshould be required reading for anyone making foreign

policy or policing our streets. Demanding the ultimate form of

responsibilityÑand vulnerabilityÑit's no wonder that Rosenberg has

received little media and mass attention. Well-written and laid out this

book is accessible and easy to read.Ó
ÑD. KILLIAN, On The Front Line, 
Cleveland Free Times
ÒChanging the way the world works sounds daunting, but Nonviolent
Communication helps liberate us from ancient patterns of violence.Ó 
ÑFRANCIS LEFKOWITZ, 
Body & Soul
ÒMarshall's unique message gives teachers easy steps for peaceful
communication and a new way to work with children and parents.Ó
ÑBARBARA MOFFITT, 
Executive Director, 
National Center for Montessori Educators
ÒI appreciate how well Nonviolent Communication reduces a very
complex and needful topic to utter simplicity.Ó
ÑHAL DOIRON, 
Director, Columbine 
Community Citizen's Task Force
Ò
Nonviolent Communication
is a masterwork. Nationally, we talk
peace. This book goes far beyond mere talk . . . it shows us how to

TEACH peace.Ó
ÑJAMES E. SHAW, PH.D., 
Jack and Jill, Why They Kill
ÒIn our present age of uncivil discourse and mean-spirited
demagoguery, racial hatreds and ethnic intolerance, the principles and

practices outlined in 
Nonviolent Communication
are as timely as they
are necessary to the peaceful resolution of conflicts, personal or

public, domestic or international.Ó
ÑMIDWEST BOOK REVIEW, TaylorÕs Shelf
Ò
Nonviolent Communication
is filled with stories of mediations in
many different situations: families, corporations, cops and gangs,

Rwandan village tribal chiefs, Israelis and Palestinians. The author

describes how, in numerous conflicts, once ÔenemiesÕ have been able

to hear each otherÕs needs, they are able to connect compassionately

and find new solutions to previously ÔimpossibleÕ impasses. He has

compiled his ideas into an easy-to-read book that clearly explains this

communication model. If you want to learn ways of more skillful

speech, I highly recommend this book.Ó
ÑDIANA LION, Buddhist Peace Fellowship, 
Turning Wheel Magazine
ÒI highly recommend Nonviolent Communication to anyone
interested in creating more intimate relationships or exploring the

connection between language and violence.Ó
ÑKATE LIN, 
The New Times 
ÒWe have lived traumatic moments over and over again, moments of
fear and panic, incomprehension, frustrations, disappointment, and

injustice of all sorts, with no hope of escape. Those who have

participated in 
Marshall RosenbergÕs training have a real desire to use
Nonviolent Communication as a peaceful alternative for ending this

interminable Rwandan conflict.Ó
ÑTHEODORE NYILIDANDI, 
Rwandan Dept. 
of Foreign Affairs - Kigali, Rwanda
ÒThis book is essential reading for anyone seeking to end the unfulfilling
cycles of argument in their relationships. Marshall Rosenberg offers a

radical challenge to centuries of thought and language that create

violence. If enough people actually learn Nonviolent Communication we

may soon live in a more peaceful and compassionate world.Ó
ÑWES TAYLOR, Progressive Health
ÒWith the growth in today's dysfunctional families and the increase
of violence in our schools, Nonviolent Communication is a godsend.Ó
ÑLINDA C. STOEHR, Los Colinas Business News
ÒI had come to realize that my old communication style was very
judgmental and full of faultfinding. Both my work associates and I

were unhappy. My life is significantly changed due to practicing

Nonviolent Communication. I am more settled and relaxed even when

I am busy. I no longer feel the need to discover fault or place blame.

Everyone is happy to be working with me for the first time in my 33

years of owning and operating my own businesses.Ó
ÑA businessman in California
ÒIf you care about healing the offender and the victims in the
community, then itÕs paramount that beginnings be made. Nonviolent

Communication is a very large step toward that goal.Ó
ÑA prison inmate 
ÒIn addition to saving our marriage, Marshall's work is helping us to
repair our relationships with our grown children and to relate more

deeply with our parents and siblings. Marshall has shown a way to

not only live, speak and act nonviolently, but a way to do so without

sacrificing or compromising yourself or others. If angels do manifest

in physical form here on this earth, then Marshall Rosenberg must

be one.Ó
ÑA reader in Arizona
ÒNonviolent Communication has catalyzed a process of clarification/
healing/empowerment in me that I could never have imagined. This

process has impacted every area of my life and continues to unfold.

For me, it unifies the spiritual truths I've found in all the world's

religions. It facilitates and strengthens connections to others and its

truths are experientially testable. In a workshop Marshall Rosenberg

said that all the great religions have ÔloveÕ at their heart, and ÔI'm just

trying to figure out how to do that.Õ I stand in awe of the model this

book teaches as a means of learning how to ÔdoÕ love and of its

elegant simplicity.Ó
ÑA reader in Florida
ÒApplying these principles to my life and using this easy four-step
process has helped me change old conditioned beliefs and ways of

acting. Nonviolent Communication allowed me to overcome my toxic

conditioning and find the loving parent and person that was locked

inside. Dr. Rosenberg has created a way to transform the violence in

the world.Ó
ÑA nurse in California
ÒAs a professional in the field, I have read many books touting most
of the topics covered in this book. But today I am ordering SEVERAL

of these, particularly for the teenagers in my life. This book practices

what it preaches, and I found the step-by-step approach, exercises,

and examples to be clear and easy to practice.Ó
ÑA reader in Maryland
I have never read a clearer, more straightforward, insightful book on
communication. After studying and teaching assertiveness since the

70s, this book is a breath of fresh air. Rosenberg adds the brilliant

insight into the linkage of feelings and needs and taking responsibility

and creates a true tool. Amazingly easy to read, great examples, and

challenging to put into practiceÑthis book is a true gift to all of us. 
ÑA reader in Washington
ÒThe single toughest, most dangerous opponent IÕd ever facedÑthe
one that truly hurt me the most, causing me to spend 30 years of my

life behind barsÑwas my own anger and fear. I write these words now,

a gray haired old man, hoping to GodÑbefore you suffer what IÕve

sufferedÑthat it will cause you to listen and learn Nonviolent

Communication. It will teach you how to recognize anger before it

becomes violence, and how to understand, deal with, and take control

of the rage you may feel.Ó
ÑA prisoner writing to fellow inmates
ÒAs a teacher, the process of Nonviolent Communication enables me
to connect more deeply; children love and respond to that deep

recognition. Parents remark that they feel heard. Solutions come more

easily and naturally. Conflicts and misunderstandings with colleagues

now become opportunities to create deeper connections. Anger,

depression, shame and guilt become friends that help me wake to

some vital need that is not being met. Read the book!Ó 
ÑA teacher in Oregon
ÒMy relationship with my husband, which was good already, has
become even better. I have taught the method to many parents who

have reported having gained a deeper understanding of their children,

thus enhancing their relationship and decreasing tension and conflict.Ó

I
Õm grateful that I was able to study and work with Professor Carl
Rogers at a time when he was researching the components of a
helping relationship. The results of this research played a key role

in the evolution of the process of communication that I will be

describing in this book.
I will be forever grateful that Professor Michael Hakeem helped
me to see the scientific limitations and the social and political

dangers of practicing psychology in the way that I had been

trained: a pathology-based understanding of human beings. Seeing

the limitations of this model stimulated me to search for ways of

practicing a different psychology, one based on a growing clarity

about how we human beings were meant to live.
IÕm grateful, too, for George MillerÕs and George AlbeeÕs efforts
to alert psychologists to the need of finding better ways for Ògiving

psychology away.Ó They helped me see that the enormity of

suffering on our planet requires more effective ways of distributing

much-needed skills than can be offered by a clinical approach.
I would like to thank Lucy Leu for editing this book and creating
the final manuscript; Rita Herzog and Kathy Smith for their editing

assistance; and for the additional help of Darold Milligan, Sonia

Nordenson, Melanie Sears, Bridget Belgrave, Marian Moore, Kittrell

McCord, Virginia Hoyte, and Peter Weismiller.
Finally, I would like to express gratitude to my friend Annie
Muller. Her encouragement to be clearer about the spiritual

foundation of my work has strengthened that work and enriched

my life.

Foreword
Arun Gandhi
Founder/President, M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence
A
s a person of color growing up in apartheid South Africa in the
1940Õs was not something anyone relished. Especially not if
you were brutally reminded of your skin color every moment of

every day. And then to be beaten up at the age of 10 by white

youths because they consider you too black and then by black

youths because they consider you too white is a humiliating

experience that would drive anyone to vengeful violence.  
I was so outraged that my parents decided to take me to India
and leave me for some time with grandfather, the legendry M. K.

Gandhi, so that I could learn from him how to deal with the anger,

the frustration, the discrimination and the humiliation that violent

color prejudice can evoke in you. In the 18 months I learned more

than I anticipated. My only regret now is that I was just 13 years

old and a mediocre student at that. If only I was older, a bit wiser

and a bit more thoughtful I could have learned so much more. But,

one must be happy with what one has received and not be greedy,

a fundamental lesson in nonviolent living. How can I forget this?
One of the many things I learned from grandfather is to
understand the depth and breadth of nonviolence and to acknowledge

that one is violent and that one needs to bring about a qualitative

change in oneÕs attitude. We often donÕt acknowledge our violence

because we are ignorant about it; we assume we are not violent

because our vision of violence is one of fighting, killing, beating,

and wars the type of things that average individuals donÕt do.  
To bring this home to me grandfather made me draw a family
tree of violence using the same principles as we do a genealogical

tree. His argument was that I would have a better appreciation of

nonviolence if I understood and acknowledged the violence that

exists in the world. He assisted me every evening to analyze the
¥
xv
¥
dayÕs happeningsÑeverything that I experienced, read about, saw
or did to othersÑand put them down on the tree either under

Òphysical" if it was violence where physical force was used or

under Òpassive" if it was the type of violence where the hurt was

more emotional.  
Within a few months I covered one wall in my room with acts
of Òpassive" violence which grandfather described as being more

insidious than Òphysical" violence. He then explained that passive

violence ultimately generated anger in the victim who, as an

individual or as a member of a collective, responded violently. In

other words it is passive violence that fuels the fire of physical

violence.  It is because we donÕt understand or appreciate this that

all our efforts to work for peace have either not fructified or that

peace has been temporary. How can we extinguish a fire if we

donÕt first cut off the fuel that ignites the inferno?
Grandfather always vociferously stressed the need for
nonviolence in communicationsÑsomething that Marshall Rosenberg

has been doing admirably for several years through his writings and

his seminars. I read with considerable interest Mr. RosenbergÕs book

Nonviolent CommunicationÑA Language of Life
and am impressed by
the depth of his work and the simplicity of the solutions.  
As grandfather would say unless Òwe become the change we
wish to see in the world" no change will ever take place. We are

all, unfortunately, waiting for the other person to change first.  
Nonviolence is not a strategy that can be used today and
discarded tomorrow; nonviolence is not something that makes

you meek or a pushover; nonviolence is about inculcating positive

attitudes to replace the negative attitudes that dominate us.

Everything that we do is conditioned by selfish motivesÑwhatÕs in

it for me. More so in an overwhelmingly materialistic society that

thrives on rugged individualism. None of these negative concepts

are conducive to building a homogenous family, community,

society or a nation.  
It is not important that we come together in a moment of crisis
and show our patriotism by flying the flag; it is not enough that
N

¥
we become a super-power by building an arsenal that can destroy
this earth several times over; it is not enough that we subjugate the

rest of the world through our military might because peace cannot

be built on the foundations of fear.  
Nonviolence means allowing the positive within you to emerge.
Be dominated by love, respect, understanding, appreciation,

compassion and concern for others rather than the self-centered

and selfish, greedy, hateful, prejudiced, suspicious and aggressive

attitudes that dominate our thinking. We often hear people say: This

world is ruthless and if you want to survive you must become

ruthless too. I humbly disagree with this contention.
This world is what we have made of it. If it is ruthless today it is
because we have made it ruthless by our attitudes. If we change

ourselves we can change the world and changing ourselves begins

with changing our language and methods of communication. I

highly recommend reading this book, and applying the Nonviolent

Communication process it teaches. It is a significant first step

towards changing our communication and creating a compassionate

world.

Words are Windows

Words are windows, or theyÕre walls,

There are things I need to say,

CHAPTER ONE
Giving from 
th e  Hear t
The Heart of Nonviolent Communication
What I want in my life is compassion, 
a flow between myself and others based 
on a mutual giving from the heart.
ÑMarshall Rosenberg
Introduction
B
elieving that it is our nature to enjoy giving and receiving 

in a compassionate manner, I have been preoccupied most of
my life with two questions. What happens to disconnect us from

our compassionate nature, leading us to behave violently and

exploitatively? And conversely, what allows some people to stay

connected to their compassionate nature under even the most

trying circumstances? 
My preoccupation with these questions began in childhood,
around the summer of 1943, when our family moved to Detroit,

Michigan. The second week after we arrived, a race war erupted

over an incident at a public park. More than forty people were

killed in the next few days. Our neighborhood was situated in the

center of the violence, and we spent three days locked in the house. 
When the race riot ended and school began, I discovered that
a name could be as dangerous as any skin color. When the teacher

called my name during attendance, two boys glared at me and

hissed, ÒAre you a kike?Ó I had never heard the word before and
¥
1
¥
didnÕt know some people used it in a derogatory way to refer to
Jews. After school, the two were waiting for me: they threw me to

the ground, kicked and beat me. 
Since that summer in 1943, I have been examining the two
questions I mentioned. What empowers us, for example, to stay

connected to our compassionate nature even under the worst

circumstances? I am thinking of people like Etty Hillesum, who

remained compassionate even while subjected to the grotesque

conditions of a German concentration camp. As she wrote in her

journal at the time,
I
am not easily frightened. Not because I am brave but

because I know that I am dealing with human
beings, and that I must try as hard as I can to

understand everything that anyone ever does. And

that was the real import of this morning: not that a

disgruntled young Gestapo officer yelled at me, but that

I felt no indignation, rather a real compassion, and

would have liked to ask, ÔDid you have a very unhappy

childhood, has your girlfriend let you down?Õ Yes, he

looked harassed and driven, sullen and weak. I should

have liked to start treating him there and then, for I

know that pitiful young men like that are dangerous as

soon as they are let loose on mankind.
ÑEtty Hillesum: A Diary.
While studying the factors that affect our ability to stay
compassionate, I was struck by the crucial role of language and

our use of words. I have since identified a specific approach to

communicatingÑspeaking and listeningÑthat leads us to give from

the heart, connecting us with ourselves and with each other in a way

that allows our natural compassion to flourish. I call this approach

Nonviolent Communication, using the term 
nonviolence
as Gandhi
used itÑto refer to our natural state of compassion when violence

has subsided from the heart. While we may not consider the waywe

Ò
Ó
talk to be Òviolent,Ó our words often lead to
hurt and pain, whether for others or ourselves.

In some communities, the process I am

describing is known as Compassionate

Communication; the abbreviation ÒNVCÓ is

used throughout this book to refer to

Nonviolent or Compassionate Communication. 
A Way To Focus Attention
NVC is founded on language and communication skills that

strengthen our ability to remain human, even under trying

conditions. It contains nothing new; all that has been integrated

into NVC has been known for centuries. The intent is to remind us

about what we already knowÑabout how we humans were meant

to relate to one anotherÑand to assist us in living in a way that

concretely manifests this knowledge. 
NVC guides us in reframing how we express ourselves and hear
others. Instead of being habitual, automatic reactions, our words

become conscious responses based firmly on an awareness of what

we are perceiving, feeling, and wanting. We are led to express

ourselves with honesty and clarity, while simultaneously paying

others a respectful and empathic attention. In any exchange, we

come to hear our own deeper needs and those of others. NVC trains

us to observe carefully, and to be able to specify behaviors and

conditions that are affecting us. We learn to identify and clearly

articulate what we are concretely wanting in a given situation. The

form is simple, yet powerfully transformative. 
As NVC replaces our old patterns of defending, withdrawing, or
attacking in the face of judgment and criticism, we come to perceive

ourselves and others, as well as our

intentions and relationships, in a new

light. Resistance, defensiveness, and

violent reactions are minimized. When

we focus on clarifying what is being

observed,felt, 
and needed rather than on diagnosing and judging, we
discover the depth of our own compassion. Through its emphasis on

deep listeningÑto ourselves as well as othersÑNVC fosters respect,

attentiveness, and empathy, and engenders a mutual desire to give

from the heart. 
Although I refer to it as Òa process of communicationÓ or a
Òlanguage of compassion,Ó NVC is more than a process or a

language. On a deeper level, it is an ongoing reminder to keep our

attention focused on a place where we are more likely to get what

we are seeking. 
There is a story of a man under a street lamp searching for
something on all fours. A policeman passing by asked what he was

doing. ÒLooking for my car keys,Ó replied the man, who appeared

slightly drunk. ÒDid you drop them here?Ó inquired the officer.

ÒNo,Ó answered the man, ÒI dropped them in the alley.Ó Seeing the

policemanÕs baffled expression, the man hastened to explain, ÒBut

the light is much better here.Ó
I find that my cultural conditioning leads me to focus attention
on places where I am unlikely to get what I want. I developed
NVC as a way to train my attentionÑ

to shine the light of consciousnessÑ

on places 
that have the potential to
yield what I am seeking. What I want in

my life is compassion, a flow between

myself and others based on a mutual

giving from the heart.
This quality of compassion, which I refer to as Ògiving from
the heart,Ó is expressed in the following lyrics by my friend,

I never feel more given to

I feel for you.
To receive with grace 

may be the greatest giving.

ThereÕs no way I can separate

When you give to me, 

I give you my receiving.

ÑSong ÒGiven ToÓ (1978) by Ruth Bebermeyer 
from the album, Given To.
When we give from the heart, we do so out of a joy that springs
forth whenever we willingly enrich another personÕs life. This kind

of giving benefits both the giver and the receiver. The receiver

enjoys the gift without worrying about the consequences that

accompany gifts given out of fear, guilt, shame, or desire for gain.

The giver benefits from the enhanced self-esteem that results when

we see our efforts contributing to someoneÕs well-being.
The use of NVC does not require that the persons with whom
we are communicating be literate in NVC or even motivated to

relate to us compassionately. If we stay with the principles of NVC,

motivated solely to give and receive compassionately, and do

everything we can to let others know this is our only motive, they

will join us in the process and eventually we will be able to

respond compassionately to one another. IÕm not saying that this

always happens quickly. I do maintain, however, that compassion

inevitably blossoms when we stay true to the principles and
process of NVC. 
The NVC Process
To arrive at a mutual desire to give from the heart, we focus the light

of consciousness on four areasÑreferred to as the four components

of the NVC model. 
First, we observe what is actually happening in a situation: what
are we observing others saying or doing that is either enriching or not

enriching our life? The trick is to be able to articulate this observation
without introducing any judgment or

evaluationÑto simply say what people are

doing that we either like or donÕt like.

Next, we state how we feel when we

observe this action: are we hurt, scared,

joyful, amused, irritated, etc.? And thirdly,

we say what needs of ours are connected

to the feelings we have identified. An
awareness of these three components is present when we use NVC to

clearly and honestly express how we are.
For example, a mother might express these three pieces to her
teenage son by saying, ÒFelix, when I see two balls of soiled socks

under the coffee table and another three next to the TV, I feel

irritated because I am needing more order in the rooms that we

share in common.Ó
She would follow immediately with the fourth componentÑa
very specific request: ÒWould you be willing to put your socks in

your room or in the washing machine?Ó This fourth component

addresses what we are wanting from the other person that would

enrich our lives or make life more wonderful for us. 
Thus, part of NVC is to express these four pieces of information
very clearly, whether verbally or by other means. The other aspect

of this communication consists of receiving the same four pieces

of information from others. We connect with them by first

sensing what they are observing, feeling, and needing, and then

Four components of NVC:

2.feeling

3.needs

4.request
discover what 
would enrich their lives by receiving the fourth
piece, their request. 
As we keep our attention focused on the areas mentioned, and
help others do likewise, we establish a flow of communication,

back and forth, until compassion manifests naturally: what I am

observing, feeling, and needing; what I am requesting to enrich my

life; what you are observing, feeling, and needing; what you are

requesting to enrich your life. . . .

How we 
feel

to what we are observing
The

When we use this process, we may begin either by expressing
ourselves or by empathically receiving these four pieces of

information from others. Although we will learn to listen for

and 
verbally express each of these
components in Chapters 3Ð6, it is

important to keep in mind that NVC

does not consist of a set formula, but

adapts to various situations as well as

personal and cultural styles. While I

word. The essence of NVC is to be found in our consciousness of
these four components, not in the actual words that are exchanged. 
Applying NVC In Our Lives And World
When we use NVC in our interactionsÑwith ourselves, with another

person, or in a groupÑwe become grounded in our natural state of

compassion. It is therefore an approach that can be effectively applied

at all levels of communication and in diverse situations:
intimate relationships

families

schools

organizations and institutions

therapy and counseling

diplomatic and business negotiations 

disputes and conflicts of any nature
Some people use NVC to create greater depth and caring in their
intimate relationships:
W
hen I learned how I can receive (hear), as well

as give (express), through using NVC, I went
beyond feeling attacked and Ôdoor mattishÕ to really

listening to words and extracting their underlying

feelings. I discovered a very hurting man to whom I

had been married for 28 years. He had asked me for

a divorce the weekend before the [NVC] workshop. To

make a long story short, we are here todayÑtogether,

and I appreciate the contribution [it has] made to our

happy ending. . . . I learned to listen for feelings, to

express my needs, to accept answers that I didnÕt

always want to hear. He is not here to make me

happy, nor am I here to create happiness for him. We

have both learned to grow, to accept and to love, so

that we can each be fulfilled.

Others use it to build more effective relationships at work. A
teacher writes:
I
have been using NVC in my special education

classroom for about one year. It can work even with
children who have language delays, learning difficulties,

and behavior problems. One student in our classroom

spits, swears, screams, and stabs other students with

pencils when they get near his desk. I cue him with,

ÔPlease say that another way. Use your giraffe talk.Õ

[Giraffe puppets are used in some workshops as a

teaching aid to demonstrate NVC.] He immediately

stands up straight, looks at the person towards whom

his anger is directed, and says calmly, ÔWould you please

move away from my desk? I feel angry when you stand

so close to me.Õ The other students might respond with

something like ÔSorry! I forgot it bothers you.Õ
I began to think about my frustration with this child
and to try to discover what I needed from him

(besides harmony and order). I realized how much

time I had put into lesson planning and how my need

for creativity and contribution were being short-

circuited in order to manage behavior. Also, I felt I

was not meeting the educational needs of the other

students. When he was acting out in class, I began to

say, ÔI need you to share my attention.Õ It might take

a hundred cues a day, but he got the message and

would usually get involved in the lesson.

A doctor writes:
I
use NVC more and more in my medical practice.
Some patients ask me whether I am a psychologist,
saying that usually their doctors are not interested

in the way they live their lives or deal with their

diseases. NVC helps me understand what the patientsÕ

needs are and what they need to hear at a given

moment. I find this particularly helpful in relating to

patients with hemophilia and AIDS because there is

so much anger and pain that the patient/healthcare-

provider relationship is often seriously impaired.

Recently a woman with AIDS, whom I have been

treating for the past five years, told me that what has

helped her the most have been my attempts to find

ways for her to enjoy her daily life. My use of NVC

helps me a lot in this respect. Often in the past, when

I knew that a patient had a fatal disease, I myself

would get caught in the prognosis, and it was hard

for me to sincerely encourage them to live their lives.

With NVC, I have developed a new consciousness as

well as a new language. I am amazed to see how

much it fits in with my medical practice. I feel more

energy and joy in my work as I become increasingly

engaged in the dance of NVC.

Still others use this process in the political arena. A French cabinet
member visiting her sister remarked how differently the sister and

her husband were communicating and responding to each other.

Encouraged by their descriptions of NVC, she mentioned that she

was scheduled the following week to negotiate some sensitive issues

between France and Algeria regarding adoption procedures. Though

time was limited, we dispatched a French-speaking trainer to

Paris to work with the cabinet minister. She later attributed much

of the 
success of her negotiations in Algeria to her newly acquired
communication techniques.
In Jerusalem, during a workshop 
attended by Israelis 
of varying
political persuasions, participants used NVC to express themselves

regarding the highly contested issue of the West Bank. Many of the

Israeli settlers who have established themselves on the West Bank

believe that they are fulfilling a religious mandate by doing so, and

they are locked in conflict not only with Palestinians but also with

other Israelis who recognize the Palestinian hope for national

sovereignty in this region. During a session, one of my trainers and

I modeled empathic hearing through NVC, and then 
invited
participants to take turns role-playing each otherÕs position.

After twenty minutes, a settler announced her willingness to

consider relinquishing her land claims and moving out of the West

Bank into internationally recognized Israeli territory if her political

opponents were able to listen to her in the way she had just been

listened to. 
Worldwide, NVC now serves as a valuable resource for
communities facing violent conflicts and severe ethnic, religious,

or political tensions. The spread of NVC training and its use in

mediation by people in conflict in Israel, the Palestinian Authority,

Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and elsewhere have been a source

of particular gratification for me. My associates and I were once in

Belgrade over three highly charged days training citizens working

for peace. When we first arrived, expressions of despair were

visibly etched on the traineesÕ faces, for their country was then

enmeshed in a brutal war in Bosnia and Croatia. As the training

progressed, we heard the ring of laughter in their voices as they

shared their profound gratitude and joy for having found the

empowerment they were seeking. Over the next two weeks, during

trainings in Croatia, Israel, and Palestine, we again saw desperate

citizens in war-torn countries regaining their spirits and

confidence from the NVC training they received.

share the richness of Nonviolent Communication with you.
Summary
NVC helps us connect with each other and ourselves in a way that

allows our natural compassion to flourish. It guides us to reframe

the way we express ourselves and listen to others by focusing our

consciousness on four areas: what we are observing, feeling, and

needing and what we are requesting to enrich our lives. NVC

fosters deep listening, respect, and empathy and engenders a

mutual desire to give from the heart. Some people use NVC to

respond compassionately to themselves, some to create greater

depth in their personal relationships, and still others to build

effective relationships at work or in the political arena. Worldwide,

NVC is used to mediate disputes and conflicts at all levels. 
NVC in Action
ÒMurderer, Assassin, Child Killer!Ó
Interspersed throughout the book are dialogues 
entitled NVC in Action. These dialogues intend to impart

the flavor of an actual exchange where a speaker is

applying the principles of Nonviolent Communication.

However, NVC is not simply a language or a set of 
techniques
for using words; the consciousness and intent that it

embraces may be expressed through silence, a quality of

presence, as well as through facial expressions and body

language. The 
NVC in Action dialogues you will be reading
are necessarily
distilled and abridged versions of real-life
exchanges, where moments of silent empathy, stories, 
humor,
gestures, etc. would all contribute to a more natural flow of

connection between the two parties than might be apparent

when dialogues are condensed in print.

I was presenting Nonviolent Communication in a
mosque at Deheisha Refugee Camp in Bethlehem to about

170 Palestinian Moslem men. Attitudes toward Americans

at that time were not favorable. As I was speaking, I

suddenly noticed a wave of muffled commotion fluttering

through the audience. ÒTheyÕre whispering that you are

American!Ó my translator alerted me, just as a gentleman

in the audience leapt to his feet. Facing me squarely, he

hollered at the top of his lungs, ÒMurderer!Ó Immediately

a dozen other voices joined him in chorus: ÒAssassin!Ó

ÒChild-killer!Ó ÒMurderer!Ó
Fortunately, I was able to focus my attention on what
the man was feeling and needing. In this case, I had some

cues. On the way into the refugee camp, I had seen several

empty tear gas canisters that had been shot into the camp

the night before. Clearly marked on each canister were the

words ÒMade in U.S.A.Ó I knew that the refugees harbored

a lot of anger toward the U.S. for supplying tear gas and

other weapons to Israel.
I addressed the man who had called me a murderer:
I:
Are you angry because you would like my government
to use its resources differently? 
(I didnÕt know whether
my guess was correct, but what is critical is my sincere

effort to connect with his feeling and need.)
He:
Damn right IÕm angry! You think we need tear gas? We
need sewers, not your tear gas! We need housing! We

need to have our own country!
I:
So youÕre furious and would appreciate some support
in improving your living conditions and gaining

political independence?
He:
Do you know what itÕs like to live here for twenty-
seven years the way I have with my familyÑchildren

and all? Have you got the faintest idea what thatÕs been

like for us?

I:

He:
You want to understand? Tell me, do you have
children? Do they go to school? Do they have

playgrounds? My son is sick! He plays in open sewage!

His classroom 
has no books! Have you seen a school that
has no books? 
I:
I hear how painful it is for you to raise your children
here; youÕd like me to know that what you want is

what all parents want for their childrenÑa good

education, opportunity to play and grow in a healthy

environment . . .
He:
ThatÕs right, the basics! Human rightsÑisnÕt that what
you Americans call it? Why donÕt more of you come here

and see what kind of human rights youÕre bringing here! 
I:
YouÕd like more Americans to be aware of the
enormity of the suffering here and to look more

deeply at the consequences of our political actions? 
Our dialogue continued, with him expressing his pain for
nearly twenty more minutes, and I listening for the feeling

and need behind each statement. I didnÕt agree or disagree.

I received his words, not as attacks, but as gifts from 

a fellow human willing to share his soul and deep

vulnerabilities with me. 
Once the gentleman felt understood, he was able to hear
me as I explained my purpose for being at the camp. An

hour later, the same man who had called me a murderer

was inviting me to his home for a Ramadan dinner.

CHAPTER TWO
Communication That
Blocks Compassion
Do not judge, and you will not be judged. 
For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged . . .
ÑHoly Bible, Matthew 7:1
I
n studying the question of what
alienates us from our natural state of
compassion, I have identified specific

forms of language and communication

that I believe contribute to our behaving

violently toward each other and ourselves.

I use the term Òlife-alienating communicationÓ to refer to these

forms of communication.
Moralistic Judgments
One kind of life-alienating communication is the use of moralistic
judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of people

who donÕt act in harmony with our values. Such judgments are

reflected in language such as, ÒThe problem with you is that youÕre

too selfish.Ó ÒSheÕs lazy.Ó ÒTheyÕre prejudiced.Ó ÒItÕs inappropriate.Ó

Blame, insults, put-downs, labels, criticism,

comparisons, and diagnoses are all forms of

judgment.
The Sufi poet Rumi once wrote, ÒOut
beyond ideas of wrongdoing and right-

doing, there is a field. IÕll meet you there.Ó
¥
15
¥
Certain ways of

communicating alienate

us from our natural

state of compassion
In the world of

judgments, our

concern centers on

WHO ÒISÓ WHAT.
Life-alienating communication, however, traps us in a world of
ideas about rightness and wrongnessÑa world of judgments; it is a

language rich with words that classify and dichotomize people and

their actions. When we speak this language, we judge others and

their behavior while preoccupying ourselves with whoÕs good, bad,

normal, abnormal, responsible, irresponsible, smart, ignorant, etc.
Long before I reached adulthood, I learned to communicate in
an impersonal way that did not require me to reveal what was

going on inside of myself. When I encountered people or behaviors

I either didnÕt like or didnÕt understand, I would react in terms of

their wrongness. If my teachers assigned a task I didnÕt want to do,

they were ÒmeanÓ or Òunreasonable.Ó If someone pulled out in

front of me in traffic, my reaction would be, ÒYou idiot!Ó When we

speak this language, we think and communicate in terms of whatÕs

wrong with others for behaving in certain ways, or occasionally,

whatÕs wrong with ourselves for not understanding or responding

as we would like. Our attention is focused on classifying,

analyzing, and determining levels of wrongness rather than on

what we and others need and not getting. Thus if my partner wants
more affection than IÕm giving her, she

is Òneedy and dependent.Ó But if I want

more affection than she is giving me,

then she is Òaloof and insensitive.Ó If

my colleague is more concerned about
details than I am, he is Òpicky and compulsive.Ó On the other hand,

if I am more concerned about details than he is, he is Òsloppy and

disorganized.Ó
It is my belief that all such analyses of other human beings are
tragic expressions of our own values and needs. They are tragic

because, when we express our values and needs in this form, we

increase defensiveness and resistance to them among the very

people whose behaviors are of concern to us. Or, if they do agree

to act in harmony with our values because they concur with our

analysis of their wrongness, they will likely do so out of fear, guilt,

or shame. 
N
ONVIOLENT
C
OMMUNICATION
_______________________________________
¥

¥
Analyses of others are

actually expressions of our

own needs and values.
We all pay dearly when people respond to our values and
needs, not out of a desire to give from the heart, but out of fear,

guilt, or shame. Sooner or later, we will experience the

consequences of diminished goodwill on the part of those who

comply with our values out of a sense of either external or internal

coercion. They, too, pay emotionally, for they are likely to feel

resentment and decreased self-esteem when they respond to us out

of fear, guilt, or shame. Furthermore, each time others associate us

in their minds with any of those feelings, we decrease the

likelihood of their responding compassionately to our needs and

values in the future.
It is important here not to confuse 
value judgments
and
moralistic judgments
. All of us make value judgments as to the
qualities we value in life; for example, we might value honesty,

freedom, or peace. Value judgments reflect our beliefs of how life

can best be served. We make 
moralistic judgments
of people and
behaviors that fail to support our value judgments, e.g. ÒViolence

is bad. People who kill others are evil.Ó Had we been raised

speaking a language that facilitated the expression of compassion,

we would have learned to articulate our needs and values directly,

rather than to insinuate wrongness when they have not been met.

For example, instead of ÒViolence is bad,Ó we might say instead, ÒI

am fearful of the use of violence to resolve conflicts; I value the

resolution of human conflicts through other means.Ó 
The relationship between language and violence is the subject
of psychology professor O.J. HarveyÕs research at the University of

Colorado. He took random samples of pieces of literature from

many countries over the world and tabulated the frequency of

words that classify and judge people. His study shows a high

correlation between the frequent use of such words and incidences

of violence. It does not surprise me to hear that there is considerably

less violence in cultures where people think in terms of human

needs than in cultures where people label one another as ÒgoodÓ or

ÒbadÓ and believe that the ÒbadÓ ones deserve to be punished. In

75 percent of the television programs shown during hours when

American children are most likely to be
watching, the hero either kills people or

beats them up. This violence typically

constitutes the ÒclimaxÓ of the show.
Viewers, having been taught that bad guys deserve to be punished,

take pleasure in watching this violence.
At the root of much, if not all, violenceÑwhether verbal,
psychological, or physical, whether among family members, tribes,

or nationsÑis a kind of thinking that attributes the cause of

conflict to 
wrongness in oneÕs adversaries, and a corresponding
inability to think of oneself or others in terms of vulnerabilityÑwhat

one might be feeling, fearing, yearning for, missing, etc. We saw this

dangerous way of thinking during the Cold War. Our leaders viewed

Russians as an Òevil empireÓ bent on destroying the American way

of life. Russian leaders referred to the people of the United States as

Òimperialist oppressorsÓ who were trying to subjugate them. Neither

side acknowledged the fear lurking behind such labels.
Making Comparisons
Another form of judgment is the use of comparisons. In his book,

How to Make Yourself Miserable
, Dan Greenberg demonstrates
through humor the insidious power that

comparative thinking can exert over us. He

suggests that if readers have a sincere desire to

make life miserable for themselves, they might
learn to compare themselves to other people. For those unfamiliar

with this practice, he provides a few exercises. The first one

displays full-length pictures of a man and a woman who embody

ideal physical beauty by contemporary media standards. Readers

are instructed to take their own body measurements, compare them

to those superimposed on the pictures of the attractive specimens,

and dwell on the differences.
This exercise produces what it promises: we start to feel
miserable as we engage in these comparisons. By the time weÕre as

depressed as we think possible, we turn the page to discover that
N
ONVIOLENT
C
OMMUNICATION
_______________________________________
¥

¥
Classifying and judging

people promote violence.
Comparisons are a

form of judgment.
the first exercise was a mere warm-up. Since physical beauty is
relatively superficial, Greenberg now provides an opportunity to

compare ourselves on something that matters: achievement. He

resorts to the phone book to give readers a few random individuals

to compare them-selves with. The first name he claims to have

pulled out of the phone book is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Greenberg lists the languages Mozart spoke and the major pieces

he had composed by the time he was a teenager. The exercise then

instructs readers to recall their own achievements at their current

stage of life, to compare them with what Mozart had accomplished

by age twelve, and to dwell on the differences.
Even readers who never emerge from the self-induced misery
of this exercise might see how powerfully this type of thinking

blocks compassion, both for oneself and for others. 
Denial Of Responsibility
Another kind of life-alienating communication is the denial of

responsibility. Life-alienating communication
clouds our awareness
that we are each responsible for our own

thoughts, feelings, and actions. The use of

the common expression Òhave toÓ as in

ÒThere are some things you have to do,

whether you like it or notÓ illustrates how

personal responsibility for our actions is obscured in such speech.

The phrase Òmakes one feelÓ as in ÒYou make me feel guiltyÓ is

another example of how language facilitates the denial of personal

responsibility for our own feelings and thoughts.
In her book, 
Eichmann in Jerusalem
, which documents the
war crimes trial of Nazi officer Adolph Eichmann, Hannah

Arendt quotes Eichmann saying that he and his fellow officers

had their own name for the responsibility-denying language

they used. They called it ÒAmtssprache,Ó loosely translated into

English as Òoffice talkÓ or Òbureaucratese.Ó For example, if

asked why they took a certain action, the response might be, ÒI

had to.Ó If asked why they Òhad to,Ó the answer would be,

an example of something she Òhad to do,Ó she retorted, ÒThatÕs

easy! When I leave here tonight, I have to go home and cook. I hate

cooking! I hate it with a passion, but I have been doing it every

day for twenty years, even when IÕve been as sick as a dog, because

itÕs one of those things you just have to do.Ó I told her I was sad to

hear her spending so much of her life doing something she hated

because she felt compelled to, and hoped that she might find

happier possibilities by learning the language of NVC.

I am pleased to report that she was a rapid student. At the
end of the workshop, she actually went home and announced to

her family that she no longer wanted to cook. The opportunity

for some feedback from her family came three weeks later when

her two sons arrived at a workshop. I was curious to know how

they had reacted to their motherÕs announcement. The elder son

sighed, ÒMarshall, I just said to myself, ÔThank God!ÕÓ Seeing my

puzzled look, he 
explained, ÒI thought
to myself, maybe 
finally she wonÕt be
complaining at 
every meal!Ó 
Another time, when I was consulting
for a school district, a teacher remarked,

ÒI hate giving grades. I donÕt think they

are helpful and they create a lot of anxiety on the part of students.

But I have to give grades: itÕs the district policy.Ó We had just been

practicing how to introduce language in the classroom that

heightens consciousness of responsibility for oneÕs actions. I

suggested that the teacher translate the statement ÒI have to give

grades because itÕs district policyÓ to ÒI choose to give grades

because I want . . 
. Ó She answered without hesitation, ÒI choose to
give grades because I want to keep my job,Ó while hastening to add,

ÒBut I donÕt like saying it that way. It

makes me feel so responsible for what IÕm

doing.Ó ÒThatÕs why I want you to do it

that way,Ó I replied.
I share the sentiments of French
novelist and journalist George Bernanos

when he says, 
I
have thought for a long time now that if, some 

day, the increasing efficiency for the technique of
destruction finally causes our species to disappear from

the earth, it will not be cruelty that will be responsible

for our extinction and still less, of course, the

indignation that cruelty awakens and the reprisals

and vengeance that it brings upon itself . . . but the
docility, the lack of responsibility of the modern man,

his base subservient acceptance of every common

horrors we shall presently see, are not signs that rebels,

insubordinate, untamable men are increasing in number

throughout the world, but rather that there is a constant

increase in the number of obedient, docile men.
Other Forms Of Life-Alienating Communication
Communicating our desires as demands is another form of language

that blocks compassion. A demand explicitly or implicitly threatens

listeners with blame or punishment if they 
fail to comply. It is a
common form of 
communication in our culture, especially 
among
those who hold positions of authority.
My children gave me some invaluable lessons about demands.
Somehow I had gotten it into my head that, as a parent, my job was
to make demands. I learned, however, that I

could make all the demands in the world but

still couldnÕt make the children do anything.

This is a humbling lesson in power for those of
us who believe that, because weÕre a parent, teacher, or manager, our

job is to change other people and make them behave. Here were

these youngsters letting me know that I couldnÕt make them do

anything. All I could do was make them wish they hadÑthrough

punishment. Then eventually they taught me that any time I was

foolish enough to make them wish they had complied by punishing

them, they had ways of making me wish that I hadnÕt!
We will examine this subject again when we learn to
differentiate requests from demandsÑan important part of NVC.
Life-alienating communication is
also associated with the concept that

certain actions merit reward while

others merit punishment. This thinking

is expressed by the word ÒdeserveÓ as in

We can never make

Thinking based on Òwho

com-
passionate communication.
Ó
ÒHe deserves to be punished for what he did.Ó It assumes ÒbadnessÓ on
the part of people who behave in certain ways, and calls for

punishment to make them repent and change their behavior. I believe

it is in everyoneÕs interest that people change, not in order to avoid

punishment, but because they see the change as benefiting themselves.
Most of us grew up speaking a language that encourages us to
label, compare, demand, and pronounce judgments rather than to

be aware of what we are feeling and

needing. I believe life-alienating

communication is rooted in views

of human nature that have exerted

their influence for several centuries.

These views stress our innate evil and deficiency, and a need for

education to control our inherently undesirable nature. Such

education often leaves us questioning whether there is something

wrong with whatever feelings and needs we may be experiencing.

We learn early to cut ourselves off from whatÕs going on within

ourselves.
Life-alienating communication both stems from and supports
hierarchical or domination societies. Where large populations are

controlled by a small number of individuals for their own benefit, it

would be to the interest of kings, czars, nobles, etc. that the masses

be educated in a way that renders them slave-like in mentality. The

language of wrongness, ÒshouldÓ and Òhave toÓ is perfectly suited for

this purpose: the more people are trained to think in terms of

moralistic judgments that imply wrongness and badness, the more

they are being trained to look outside themselvesÑto outside

authoritiesÑfor the definition of what constitutes right, wrong, good

and bad. When we are in contact with our feelings and needs, we

humans no longer make good slaves and underlings. 
Summary
It is our nature to enjoy giving and receiving compassionately.

We have, however, learned many forms of Òlife-alienating

communicationÓ that lead us to speak and behave in ways that

injure others and ourselves. One form of life-alienating
communication is the use of moralistic judgments that imply

wrongness or badness on the part of those who donÕt act in

harmony with our values. Another form of such communication is

the use of comparisons, which can block compassion both for

others and ourselves. Life-alienating communication also obscures

our awareness that we are each responsible for our own thoughts,

feelings, and actions. Communicating our desires in the form of

demands is yet another characteristic of language that blocks

compassion.

he first component of NVC entails the 
separation
of observation
from evaluation. We need to clearly observe what we are seeing,
hearing, or touching that is affecting our sense of well-being,

without mixing in any evaluation. 
Observations are an important element in NVC, where we wish
to clearly and honestly express how we are to another person. When

we combine observation with evaluation, however, we decrease the

likelihood that others will hear our intended message. Instead, they

are apt to hear criticism and thus resist what we are saying. 
NVC does not mandate that we remain completely objective
and refrain from evaluating. It only requires that we maintain a

separation between our observations and our evaluations. NVC is

a process language that discourages static generalizations; instead,
evaluations are to be based on

observations 
specific to time and
context
. Semanticist Wendell
Johnson pointed out that we create

many problems for ourselves by
using static language to express or capture a reality that is ever

changing: ÒOur language is an imperfect instrument created by

ancient and ignorant men. It is an animistic language that invites

us to talk about stability and constants, about similarities and

normal and kinds, about magical transformations, quick cures,

simple problems, and final solutions. Yet the world we try to

symbolize with this language is a world of process, change,

differences, dimensions, functions, relationships, growths,

interactions, developing, learning, coping, complexity. And the

mismatch of our ever-changing world and our relatively static

language forms is part of our problem.Ó 
A colleague of mine, Ruth Bebermeyer, contrasts static and
process language in a song that illustrates the difference between

evaluation and observation.

IÕve never seen a lazy man; 
IÕve seen a man who never ran

a man who sometimes slept between

lunch and dinner, and whoÕd stay

Before you call me crazy,

think, was he a lazy man or 

did he just do things we label ÒlazyÓ?
IÕve never seen a stupid kid;
IÕve seen a kid who sometimes did

things I didnÕt understand

IÕve seen a kid who hadnÕt seen

some just call a different knowing,
so IÕve come to the conclusion, 

it will save us all confusion

if we donÕt mix up what we can see 

with what is our opinion.

Because you may, I want to say also;

I know thatÕs only my opinion. 
While the effects of negative labels such as ÒlazyÓ and ÒstupidÓ
may be more obvious, even a positive or an apparently neutral

label such as ÒcookÓ limits our perception of the totality of another

personÕs being.
The Highest Form Of Human Intelligence
The Indian philosopher J. Krishnamurti once remarked that

observing without evaluating is the highest form of human

intelligence. When I first read this statement, the thought, ÒWhat

nonsense!Ó shot through my mind before I realized that I had

just made an evaluation. For most of us, it is difficult to make

observations of people and their behavior that are free of judgment,

criticism, or other forms of analysis. 
I became acutely aware of this difficulty while working with an
elementary school where the staff and principal often reported

communication difficulties. The district superintendent had

requested that I help them resolve the conflict. First I was to confer

with the staff, and then with the staff and principal together. 
I opened the meeting by asking the staff, ÒWhat is the
principal doing that conflicts with your needs?Ó ÒHe has a big

mouth!Ó came the swift response. My question called for an

observation, but while Òbig mouthÓ gave me information on how

this teacher evaluated the principal, it failed to describe what the

principal 
said or did
that led to the teacherÕs interpretation that
he had a Òbig mouth.Ó 
When I pointed this out, a second teacher offered, ÒI know
what he means: the principal talks too much!Ó Instead of a clear
N

observation of the principalÕs behavior, this was also an evaluationÑ
of how much the principal talked. A third teacher then declared, ÒHe

thinks only he has anything worth saying.Ó I explained that inferring

what another person is thinking is not the same as observing his

behavior. Finally a fourth teacher ventured, ÒHe wants to be the

center of attention all the time.Ó After I remarked that this too was

an inferenceÑof what another person is wantingÑtwo teachers

blurted in unison, ÒWell, your question is very hard to answer!Ó
We subsequently worked together to create a list identifying
specific behaviors 
on the part of the principal that bothered them, and
made sure that the list was free of evaluation. For example, the

principal told stories about his childhood and war experiences during

faculty meetings, with the result that meetings sometimes ran

20 minutes overtime. When I asked whether they had ever

communicated their annoyance to the principal, the staff replied they

had tried, but only through evaluative comments. They had never

made reference to specific behaviorsÑsuch as his story tellingÑand

agreed to bring these up when we were all to meet together.
Almost as soon as the meeting began, I saw what the staff had
been telling me. No matter what was being discussed, the principal

would interject, ÒThis reminds me of the time . . . Ó and then launch

into a story about his childhood or war experience. I waited for the

staff to voice their discomfort around the principalÕs behavior.

However, instead of Nonviolent Communication, they applied

nonverbal condemnation. Some rolled their eyes; other yawned

pointedly; one stared at his watch. 
I endured this painful scenario until finally I asked, ÒIsnÕt anyone
going to say something?Ó An awkward silence ensued. The teacher

who had spoken first at our meeting screwed up his courage, looked

directly at the principal, and said, ÒEd, you have a big mouth.Ó
As this story illustrates, itÕs not always easy to shed our old
habits and master the ability to separate observation from

evaluation. Eventually, the teachers succeeded in clarifying for the

principal the specific actions that led to their concern. The principal

listened earnestly and then pressed, ÒWhy didnÕt one of you tell me

before?Ó He admitted he was aware of his story-telling habit, and
then began a story pertaining to this habit! I interrupted him,

observing (good-naturedly) that he was doing it again. We ended

our meeting developing ways for the staff to let their principal

know, in a gentle way, when his stories werenÕt appreciated.

Summary
The first component of NVC entails the separation of observation
from evaluation. When we combine observation with evaluation,

others are apt to hear criticism and resist what we are saying.

NVC is a 
process language that discourages static generalizations.
Instead, observations are to be made specific to time and context,

e.g. ÒHank Smith has not scored a goal in 20 gamesÓ rather than

ÒHank Smith is a poor soccer player.Ó
NVC in Action
ÒThe most arrogant speaker weÕve ever had!Ó
This dialogue occurred during a workshop I was conducting.

About half an hour into my presentation, I paused to

invite reactions from the participants. One of them raised

a hand and declared, ÒYouÕre the most arrogant speaker

weÕve ever had!Ó
I have several options open to me when people address
me this way. One option is to take the message personally;

I know IÕm doing this when I have a strong urge to either

grovel, defend myself, or make excuses. Another option (for

which I am well-rehearsed) is to attack the other person for

what I perceive as their attack upon me. On this occasion,

I chose a third option by focusing on what might be going

on behind the manÕs statement.
MBR:

present my views before giving you a chance to talk?

ThatÕs right.

Would you like

Yes.
MBR:(Having gotten clear on 
his observation, feeling, need,

willing to do as he requests)
Yes, this process is often
difficult for me. As we continue with the workshop,

youÕll probably hear me describe several incidents

where IÕve struggled . . . or completely lost touch . . .

with this process, this consciousness, that I am

presenting here to you. But what keeps me in the

struggle are the close connections to other people

that happen when I do stay with the process.

OBSERVATION OR EVALUATION?
To determine your proficiency at discerning between observations
and evaluations, complete the following exercise. Circle the 
number
in front of any statement that is an observation only, with no

evaluation mixed in. 
1.ÒJohn was angry with me yesterday for no reason.Ó
2.ÒYesterday evening Nancy bit her fingernails while watching
television.Ó
3.ÒSam didnÕt ask for my opinion during the meeting.Ó

4.ÒMy father is a good man.Ó

5.ÒJanice works too much.Ó

6.ÒHenry is aggressive.Ó

7.ÒPam was first in line every day this week.Ó

8.ÒMy son often doesnÕt brush his teeth.Ó

9.ÒLuke told me I didnÕt look good in yellow.Ó
10.ÒMy aunt complains when I talk with her.Ó
Here are my responses for Exercise 1:
1.If you circled this number, weÕre not in agreement. I consider
Òfor no reasonÓ to be an evaluation. Furthermore, I consider it

an evaluation to infer that John was angry. He might have

been feeling hurt, scared, sad, or something else. Examples of

observations without evaluation might be: ÒJohn told me he

was angry,Ó or ÒJohn pounded his fist on the table.Ó

CHAPTER FOUR
Identif y ing and
Expressing Feelings
T
he first component of NVC is to observe without evaluating;
the second component is to express how we are feeling.
Psychoanalyst Rollo May suggests that Òthe mature person

becomes able to differentiate feelings into as many nuances,

strong and passionate experiences, or delicate and sensitive ones

as in the different passages of music in a symphony.Ó For many of

us, however, our feelings are, as May would describe it, Òlimited

like notes in a bugle call.Ó 
The Heavy Cost Of Unexpressed Feelings
Our repertoire of words for calling people names is often larger

than our vocabulary of words that allow us to clearly describe our

emotional states. I went through twenty-one years of American

schools and canÕt recall anyone in all that time ever asking me how

I felt. Feelings were simply not considered important. What was

valued was Òthe right way to thinkÓÑas defined by those who held

positions of rank and authority. We are trained to be Òother-

directedÓ rather than to be in contact with ourselves. We learn to

be Òup in our headÓ wondering, ÒWhat is it that others think is

right for me to say and do?Ó 
An interaction I had with a teacher when I was about nine
years old demonstrates how alienation from our feelings can begin.

Once I hid myself after school in a classroom because some boys

were waiting outside to beat me up. A teacher spotted me and
¥
37
¥
asked me to leave the school. When I explained I was afraid to go,
she declared, ÒBig boys donÕt get frightened.Ó A few years later I

received further reinforcement through my participation in

athletics. It was typical for coaches to value athletes willing to

Ògive their allÓ and continue playing no matter how much physical

pain they were in. I learned the lesson so well I once continued

playing baseball for a month with an untreated broken wrist. 
At an NVC workshop, a college student spoke about a
roommate who played the stereo so loudly it kept him awake.

When asked to express what he felt when this happened, the

student replied, ÒI feel that it isnÕt right to play music so loud at

night.Ó I pointed out that when he followed the word feel with the

word that, he was expressing an opinion but not revealing his

feelings. Asked to try again to express his feelings, he responded,

ÒI feel, when people do something like that, itÕs a personality

disturbance.Ó I explained that this was still an opinion rather than

a feeling. He paused thoughtfully, and then announced with

vehemence, ÒI have no feelings about it whatsoever!Ó
This student obviously had strong feelings. Unfortunately, he
didnÕt know how to become aware of his feelings, let alone express

them. This difficulty in identifying and expressing feelings is

common, and in my experience, especially so among lawyers,

engineers, police officers, corporate managers, and career military

personnelÑpeople whose professional codes discourage them

from 
manifesting emotions. For families, the toll is severe when
members are unable to communicate emotions. Country and

western singer Reba McIntire wrote a song after her fatherÕs death,

and titled it ÒThe Greatest Man I Never Knew.Ó In so doing, she

undoubtedly expressed the sentiments of many people who were

never able to establish the emotional connection they would have

liked with their fathers. 
I regularly hear statements like, ÒI wouldnÕt want you to get the
wrong ideaÑIÕm married to a wonderful manÑbut I never know

what he is feeling.Ó One such dissatisfied woman brought her

spouse to a workshop, during which she told him, ÒI feel like IÕm

married to a wall.Ó The husband then did an excellent imitation of
a wall: he sat mute and immobile. Exasperated, she turned to me

and exclaimed, ÒSee! This is what happens all the time. He sits and

says nothing. ItÕs just like living with a wall.Ó
ÒIt sounds to me like you are feeling lonely and wanting more
emotional contact with your husband,Ó I responded. When she

agreed, I tried to show how statements such as ÒI feel like IÕm

living with a wallÓ are unlikely to bring her feelings and desires

to her husbandÕs attention. In fact, they are more likely to be

heard as criticism than an invitation to connect with our feelings.

Furthermore, such statements often lead to self-fulfilling 
prophecies.
A husband, for example, hears himself criticized for behaving like

a wall; he is hurt and discouraged and doesnÕt respond, thereby

confirming his wifeÕs image of him as a wall. 
The benefits of strengthening our feelings vocabulary are
evident not only in intimate relationships, but also in the

professional world. I was once hired to consult with the members

of a technological department of a large Swiss corporation 
troubled
by the discovery that workers in other departments were avoiding

them. When asked why, employees from other departments

responded, ÒWe hate going there to consult with those people. ItÕs

like talking to a bunch of machines!Ó The problem abated when I

spent time with the members of the technological department,

encouraging them to express more of their humanness in their

communications with co-workers. 
In another instance, I was working with the administrators of
a hospital who were anxious about a forthcoming meeting with the

hospitalÕs physicians. They wanted support for a project that the

physicians had only recently turned down by a vote of 17 to 1. The

administrators were eager to have me demonstrate how they might

use NVC when approaching the physicians. 
Assuming the voice of an administrator in a role-playing
session, I opened with, ÒIÕm feeling frightened to be bringing up this

issue.Ó I chose to start this way because I sensed how frightened

the administrators were as they prepared to confront the physicians

on this topic again. Before I could continue, one of the administrators
stopped me to protest, ÒYouÕre being unrealistic! We could never tell

the physicians that we were frightened.Ó
When I asked why an admission of fear seemed so impossible, he
replied without hesitation, ÒIf we admitted weÕre frightened, then they

would just pick us to pieces!Ó His answer didnÕt surprise me; I have

often heard people say how they cannot imagine ever expressing

feelings at their workplace. I was pleased to learn, however, that one

of the administrators did decide to risk expressing his vulnerability at

the dreaded meeting. Instead of his customary manner of appearing

strictly logical, rational and unemotional, he chose to state his

feelings together with reasons for wanting the physicians to change

their position. He noticed how differently the physicians responded to

him. In the end he was amazed and relieved when, instead of being
Òpicked to 
piecesÓ by the physicians,
they reversed their previous position,

voting 17 to 1 to support the project

instead. This dramatic turnaround
helped the administrators realize and appreciate the potential

impact of expressing oneÕs vulnerabilityÑeven in the workplace. 
Finally, let me share a personal incident that taught me the
effects of hiding our feelings. I was teaching a course in NVC to a

group of inner city students. When I walked into the room the first

day, the students, who had been enjoying a lively conversation

with each other, became quiet. ÒGood morning!Ó I greeted. Silence.

I felt very uncomfortable, but was afraid to express it. Instead, I

proceeded in my most professional manner, ÒFor this class, we will

be studying a process of communication that I hope you will find

helpful in your relationships at home and with your friends.Ó 
I continued to present information about NVC, but no one
seemed to be listening. One girl, rummaging through her bag,

fished out a file and began vigorously filing her nails. Students

near the windows glued their faces to the pane as if fascinated by

what was going on in the street below. I felt increasingly more

uncomfortable, yet continued to say nothing. Finally, a student

who had certainly more courage than I was demonstrating, piped
up, ÒYou just hate being with black people, donÕt you?Ó I was

stunned, yet immediately realized how I had contributed to this

studentÕs perception by trying to hide my discomfort. 
ÒI 
am
feeling nervous,Ó I admitted, Òbut not because you are
black. My feelings have to do with my not knowing anyone here

and wanting to be accepted when I came in the room.Ó This

expression of my vulnerability had a pronounced effect on the

students. They started to ask questions about me, to tell me things

about themselves, and to express curiosity about NVC. 
Feelings Versus Non-Feelings
A common confusion generated by the English language is our use

of the word 
feel
without actually expressing a feeling. For example,
in the sentence, ÒI feel I didnÕt get a fair deal,Ó the words ÒI feelÓ

could be more accurately replaced with ÒI think.Ó In general, feelings

are not being clearly expressed when the word 
feel
is followed by: 
a)words such as 
that
, 
like
, as 
if
:
ÒI feel 
that
you should know better.Ó
ÒI feel 
like
a failure.Ó
ÒI feel 
as
if IÕm living with a wall.Ó
b)the pronouns 
I

, 
he
,

,

, 
it
:
ÒI feel 
I
am constantly on call.Ó
ÒI feel 
it
is useless.Ó
c)names or nouns referring to people:
ÒI feel 
Amy
has been pretty responsible.Ó
ÒI feel 
my boss
is being manipulative.Ó 
Conversely, in the English language, it
is not necessary at all to use the word 
feel
when we are actually expressing a feeling:

we can say ÒIÕm feeling irritated,Ó or

simply, ÒIÕm irritated.Ó

Distinguish feelings
from thoughts.
Distinguish between

WHATWEFEEL and

WHATWETHINK we are.
In NVC, we distinguish between words that express actual
feelings and those that describe 
what we think we are
. 
A. Description of what we 
think
we are:
ÒI feel 
inadequate
as a guitar player.Ó 
In this statement, I am assessing my ability as a guitar player,
rather than clearly expressing my feelings.
B. Expressions of actual feelings:
ÒI feel 
disappointed
in myself as a guitar player.Ó
ÒI feel 
impatient
with myself as a guitar player.Ó
ÒI feel 
frustrated
with myself as a guitar player.Ó
The actual feeling behind my assessment of myself as

ÒinadequateÓ could therefore be disappointment,

impatience, frustration, or some other emotion.
Likewise, it is helpful to differentiate between words that
describe what we think others are doing around us, and words
that describe 
actual feelings. The
following are examples of statements

that are easily mistaken as expressions

of feelings: in fact they reveal more

how we think others are behaving
than
what we are actually feeling ourselves: 
A. ÒI feel unimportant to the people with whom I work.Ó 
The word 
unimportant
describes how I think others are
evaluating me, rather than an actual feeling, which in this

situation might be ÒI feel 
sad
Ó or ÒI feel 
discouraged
.Ó
B. ÒI feel misunderstood.Ó 
Here the word 
misunderstood
indicates my assessment of
the other personÕs level of understanding rather than an

actual feeling. In this situation, I may be feeling 
anxious
or
annoyed
or some other emotion.

Building A Vocabulary For Feelings
In expressing our feelings, it helps to use words that refer to
specific emotions, rather than words that are vague or general. For

example, if we say, ÒI feel good about that,Ó the word 
good
could
mean 
happy
, 
excited
, 
relieved
or a number of other emotions.
Words such as 
good
and 
bad
prevent the listener from connecting
easily with what we might actually be feeling.
The following lists have been compiled to help you increase
your power to articulate feelings and clearly describe a whole

range of emotional states. 
¥
43
¥
C.ÒI feel 
ignored
.Ó
Again, this is more of an interpretation of the actions of

others rather than a clear statement of how we are feeling.

No doubt there have been times we thought we were being

ignored and our feeling was 
relief
, because we wanted to be
left to ourselves. No doubt there were other times, however,

when we felt 
hurt
when we thought we were being ignored,
because we had wanted to be involved.
Words like ÒignoredÓ express how we 
interpretothers
, rather
than how we 
feel
. Here is a sampling of such words.

Summary
The second component necessary for expressing ourselves is
feelings. By developing a vocabulary of feelings that allows us to

clearly and specifically name or identify our emotions, we can

connect more easily with one another. Allowing ourselves to be

vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts.

NVC distinguishes the expression of actual feelings from words and

statements that describe thoughts, assessments, and interpretations.

Exercise 2
EXPRESSING FEELINGS
If you would like to see whether weÕre in agreement about the
verbal expression of feelings, circle the number in front of any of

the following statements in which feelings are verbally expressed.
1.ÒI feel you donÕt love me.Ó
2.ÒIÕm sad that youÕre leaving.Ó

3.ÒI feel scared when you say that.Ó

4.ÒWhen you donÕt greet me, I feel neglected.Ó

5.ÒIÕm happy that you can come.Ó

6.ÒYouÕre disgusting.Ó

7.ÒI feel like hitting you.Ó

8.ÒI feel misunderstood.Ó

9.ÒI feel good about what you did for me.Ó
10.ÒIÕm worthless.Ó
Here are my responses for Exercise 2:
1.If you circled this number, weÕre not in agreement. I donÕt
consider Òyou donÕt love meÓ to be a feeling. To me, it

expresses what the speaker thinks the other person is feeling,

rather than how the speaker is feeling. Whenever the words ÒI

feelÓ are followed by the words ÒI,Ó Òyou,Ó Òhe,Ó Òshe,Ó Òthey,Ó

Òit,Ó Òthat,Ó Òlike,Ó or Òas if,Ó what follows is generally not what

I would consider to be a feeling. Examples of an expression of

feeling might be: ÒIÕm sadÓ or ÒIÕm feeling anguished.Ó
2.If you circled this number, weÕre in agreement that a feeling
was verbally expressed.

expression of feeling might be: ÒWhen you donÕt greet me at

the door, I feel lonely.Ó 
5.If you circled this number, weÕre in agreement that a feeling
was verbally expressed.
6.If you circled this number, weÕre not in agreement. I donÕt
consider ÒdisgustingÓ to be a feeling. To me, it expresses how

the speaker thinks about the other person, rather than how the

speaker is feeling. An expression of feeling might be: ÒI feel

disgusted.Ó 
7.If you circled this number, weÕre not in agreement. I donÕt
consider Òlike hitting youÓ to be a feeling. To me, it expresses

what the speaker imagines doing, rather than how the speaker

is feeling. An expression of feeling might be: ÒI am furious

at you.Ó 
8.If you circled this number, weÕre not in agreement. I donÕt
consider ÒmisunderstoodÓ to be a feeling. To me, it expresses

what the speaker thinks the other person is doing. An

expression of feeling in this case might be, ÒI feel frustrated,Ó

or ÒI feel discouraged.Ó 
9.If you circled this number, weÕre in agreement that a feeling
was verbally expressed. However, the word ÒgoodÓ is vague

when used to convey a feeling. We can usually express our

feelings more clearly by using other words, e.g. in this

instance: Òrelieved,Ó Ògratified,Ó or Òencouraged.Ó 
10.If you circled this number, weÕre not in agreement. I donÕt
consider ÒworthlessÓ to be a feeling. To me, it expresses how

the speaker thinks about him or herself, rather than how the

speaker is feeling. Examples of an expression of feeling might

be: ÒI feel skeptical about my own talents,Ó or ÒI feel wretched.Ó

CHAPTER FIVE
Taking Responsibility 
For Our Feelings 
ÒPeople are disturbed not by things, 
but by the view they take of them.Ó
ÑEpictetus
Hearing A Negative Message: Four Options
T
he third component of NVC entails

the acknowledgment of the root
of our feelings. NVC heightens our

awareness that what others say and

do may be the 
stimulus
, but never the
cause
of our feelings. We see that our feelings result from how we
choose
to receive what others say and do, as well as our particular
needs and expectations in that moment. With the third 
component,
we are led to accept responsibility for what we do to generate our

own feelings. 
When someone gives us a negative message, whether
verbally or nonverbally, we have four options as to how to

receive it. One is to take it personally by hearing blame and

criticism. For example, someone is angry and says, ÒYouÕre the

most self-centered person IÕve ever

met!Ó In choosing to take it personally,

we might react, ÒOh, I shouldÕve been

more sensitive!Ó We accept the other

personÕs judgment and blame

ourselves. We choose this option
¥
49
¥
What others do may be the

stimulus of our feelings,

but not the cause.
Four options for receiving

negative messages:
1. Blaming ourselves
at a great cost to our self-esteem, for it inclines us toward
feelings of guilt, shame, and depression. 
A second option is to fault the speaker. For example, in
response to ÒYouÕre the most self-centered person IÕve ever met,Ó
we might protest, ÒYou have no right to say

that! I am always considering your needs.

YouÕre the one who is really self-centered.Ó
When we receive messages this way, and blame the speaker, we are

likely to feel anger.
When receiving a negative message, our third option would be
to shine the light of consciousness on our own feelings and needs.
Thus, we might reply, ÒWhen I hear you

saying that I am the most self-centered

person youÕve ever met, I feel hurt, because

I need some recognition of my efforts to be
considerate of your preferences.Ó By focusing attention on our own

feelings and needs, we become conscious that our current feeling

of hurt derives from a need for our efforts to be recognized.
Finally, a fourth option in receiving a negative message is to
shine the light of consciousness on the 
other
personÕs feelings and
needs as they are currently expressed. We

might for example ask, ÒAre you feeling

hurt because you need more consideration

for your preferences?Ó 
We accept responsibility rather than blame other people for our
feelings by acknowledging our own needs, desires, expectations,

values, or thoughts. Note the difference between the following

expressions of disappointment:
Example 1
A:ÒYou disappointed me by not coming over last evening.Ó
B:ÒI was disappointed when you didnÕt come over, because I
wanted to talk over some things that were bothering me.Ó
Speaker A attributes responsibility for the disappointment solely
N
ONVIOLENT
C
OMMUNICATION
_______________________________________
¥
50
¥
2.Blaming others
3.Sensing our own
feelings and needs
4.Sensing othersÕ 
feelings and needs
to the action of the other person. In B, the feeling of disappointment
is traced to the speakerÕs own desire that was not being fulfilled. 
Example 2
A:ÒTheir cancelling the contract really irritated me!Ó

B:ÒWhen they cancelled the contract, I felt really irritated
because I was thinking to myself that it was an awfully

irresponsible thing to do.Ó
Speaker A attributes her irritation solely to the behavior of the
other party, whereas Speaker B accepts responsibility for her

feeling by acknowledging the thought behind it. She recognizes

that her blaming way of thinking has generated her irritation. In

NVC, however, we would urge this speaker to go a step further by

identifying what she is wanting: what need, desire, expectation,

hope, or value of hers has not been fulfilled? As we shall see, the

more we are able to connect our feelings to our own needs, the

easier it is for others to respond compassionately. To relate her

feelings to what she is wanting, Speaker B might have said: 
ÒWhen they cancelled the contract, I felt really irritated because
I was hoping for an opportunity to re-hire the workers we had laid

off last year.Ó 
The basic mechanism of motivating by
guilt is to attribute the responsibility for

oneÕs own feelings to others. When parents

say, ÒIt hurts Mommy and Daddy when

you get poor grades at school,Ó they are implying that the childÕs

actions are the cause of the parentsÕ happiness or unhappiness. On

the surface, feeling responsible for the feelings of others can easily

be mistaken for positive caring. It appears that the child cares for

the parent and feels bad because the parent is suffering. However,

if children who assume this kind of responsibility change their

behavior in accordance to parental wishes, they are not acting

from the heart, but acting to avoid guilt.

Distinguish between

giving from the heart

and being motivated

out of guilt.
It is helpful to recognize a number of common speech patterns
that tend to mask accountability for our own feelings: 
1)Use of impersonal pronouns such as ÒitÓ and ÒthatÓ: ÒIt
really infuriates me when spelling mistakes appear in our

public brochures.Ó ÒThat bugs me a lot.Ó
2)Statements that mention only the actions of others:
ÒWhen you donÕt call me on my birthday, I feel hurt.Ó

ÒMommy is disappointed when you donÕt finish your food.Ó
3)The use of the expression ÒI feel (an emotion) because . . . Ó
followed by a person or personal pronoun other than ÒIÓ:

ÒI feel hurt because you said you donÕt love me.Ó ÒI feel

angry because the supervisor broke her promise.Ó 
In each of these instances, we can deepen
our awareness of our own responsibility

by substituting the phrase, ÒI feel . . .

because I . . . Ó For example: 
1)Ò
Ifeel
really infuriated when spelling mistakes like that
appear in our public brochures, 
because I
want our company
to project a professional image.Ó 
2)Ò

because I
want you to grow up strong and healthy.Ó 
3)Ò
Ifeel
angry that the supervisor broke her promise, 
because

was counting on getting that long weekend to visit my
brother.Ó
The Needs At The Roots Of Feelings
Judgments, criticisms, diagnoses, and
interpretations of others are all alienated

expressions of our needs. If someone says,

ÒYou never understand me,Ó they are really

telling us that their need to be understood
is not being fulfilled. If a wife says, ÒYouÕve been working late

every night this week; you love your work more than you love

me,Ó she is saying that her need for intimacy is not being met. 
When we express our needs indirectly through the use of
evaluations, interpretations, and images, others are likely to hear

criticism. And when people hear anything

that sounds like criticism, they tend to

invest their energy in self-defense or

counterattack. If we are wishing for a

compassionate response from others, it is

self-defeating to express our needs by interpreting or diagnosing

their behavior. Instead, the more directly we can connect our

feelings to our own needs, the easier it is for others to respond

compassionately to our needs.
Unfortunately, most of us have never been taught to think in
terms of needs. We are accustomed to thinking about whatÕs wrong

with other people when our needs arenÕt being fulfilled. Thus, if we

want coats to be hung up in the closet, we may characterize our

children as lazy for leaving them on the couch. Or we may

interpret our co-workers as being irresponsible when they donÕt go

about their tasks as we would prefer them to.
I was once invited to mediate in southern California between
some landowners and migrant farm workers whose conflicts had

grown increasingly hostile and violent. I began the meeting by

asking them two questions: ÒWhat is it that you are each needing?

And what would you like to request of the other in relation to these

needs?Ó ÒThe problem is that these people are racist!Ó shouted a

farm worker. ÒThe problem is that these people donÕt respect law

and order!Ó shouted a landowner even more loudly. As is often the

case, these groups were more skilled in analyzing the perceived

wrongness of others than in clearly expressing their own needs. 
In a comparable situation, I once met with a group of Israelis
and Palestinians who wanted to establish the mutual trust necessary

to bring peace to their homelands. I opened the session with the

same questions, ÒWhat is it you are needing and what would you

like to request from one another in relation to those needs?Ó

Instead of directly stating his needs, a Palestinian mukhtar (who is

like a village mayor) answered, ÒYou people are acting like a bunch
of Nazis.Ó A statement like that is not likely to get the cooperation

of a group of Israelis! 
Almost immediately, an Israeli woman jumped up and
countered, ÒMukhtar, that was a totally insensitive thing for you to

say!Ó Here were people who had come together to build trust and

harmony, but after only one interchange, matters were worse than

before they began. This happens often when people are used to

analyzing and blaming one another rather than clearly expressing

what they need. In this case, the woman could have responded to

the Mukhtar in terms of her own needs and requests by saying, for

example, ÒI am needing more respect in our dialogue. Instead of

telling us how you think we are acting, would you tell us what it

is we are doing that you find disturbing?Ó
Over and over again, it has been my experience that, from the
moment people begin talking about what they need rather than

whatÕs wrong with one another, the possibility of finding ways to

meet everybodyÕs needs is greatly increased. The following are

some of the basic human needs we all share:

The Pain Of Expressing Our Needs Versus 
The Pain Of Not Expressing Our Needs
In a world where weÕre often judged harshly for identifying and
revealing our needs, doing so can be very frightening. Women, in

particular, are susceptible to criticism. For centuries, the image of

the loving woman has been associated with sacrifice and the denial

of her own needs to take care of others. Because women are

socialized to view the care taking of others as their highest duty,

they have often learned to ignore their own needs. 
At one workshop, we discussed what happens to women who
internalize such beliefs. These women, if they ask for what they

want, will often do so in a way that both reflects and reinforces the

beliefs that they have no genuine right to their needs, and that their

needs are unimportant. For example, because she is fearful of asking
for what she needs, a woman may fail to simply say that sheÕs had a

busy day, is feeling tired and wants some time in the evening to

herself; instead, her words come out sounding like a legal case: ÒYou

know I havenÕt had a moment to myself all day, I ironed all the shirts,

did the whole weekÕs laundry, took the dog to the vet, made dinner,

packed the lunches, and called all the neighbors about the block

meeting, so [imploringly] . . . so how about if you . . . ?Ó ÒNo!Ó comes

the swift response. Her plaintive request elicits resistance rather than

compassion from her listeners. They have difficulty hearing and

valuing the needs behind her pleas, and furthermore react negatively

to her weak attempt to argue from a position of what she ÒshouldÓ or

ÒdeservesÓ to get from them. In the end the speaker is again persuaded

that her needs donÕt matter, not realizing that they were expressed in

a way unlikely to draw a positive response.
My mother was once at a workshop where
other women were discussing how frightening it

was to be expressing their needs. Suddenly she got

up and left the room and didnÕt return for a long

time. She finally reappeared, looking very pale. In
the presence of the group, I asked, ÒMother, are you all right?Ó

ÒWhatÕs that?Ó

ÒIÕve just become aware that I was angry for 36 years with your
father for not meeting my needs, and now I realize that I never

once clearly told him what I needed.Ó
My motherÕs revelation was accurate. Not one time can I
remember her clearly expressing her needs to my father. SheÕd hint

around and go through all kinds of convolutions, but never would

she ask directly for what she needed. 
We tried to understand why it was so hard for her to have done
so. My mother grew up in an economically impoverished family.

She recalled asking for things as a child and being admonished by

her brothers and sisters, ÒYou shouldnÕt ask for that! You know

weÕre poor. Do you think you are the only person in the family?Ó
Eventually she grew to fear that asking for what she needed would

only lead to disapproval and judgment.
She related a childhood anecdote about one of her sisters who had
had an appendix operation and afterwards had been given a beautiful

little purse by another sister. My mother was 14 at the time. Oh, how

she yearned to have an exquisitely beaded purse like her sisterÕs, but

she dared not open her mouth. So guess what? She feigned a pain in

her side and went the whole way with her story. Her family took her

to several doctors. They were unable to produce a diagnosis and so

opted for exploratory surgery. It had been a bold gamble on my

motherÕs part, but it workedÑshe was given an identical little purse!

When she received the coveted purse, my mother was elated despite

being in physical agony from the surgery. Two nurses came in and one

stuck a thermometer in her mouth. My mother said, ÒUmmm, ummm,Ó

to show the purse to the second nurse, who answered, ÒOh, for me?

Why, thank you!Ó and took the purse! My mother was at a loss, and

never figured out how to say, ÒI didnÕt mean to give it to you. Please

return it to me.Ó Her story poignantly reveals how painful it can be

when people donÕt openly acknowledge their needs.
From Emotional Slavery To 
Emotional Liberation
In our development toward a state of emotional liberation, most of
us seem to experience three stages in the way we relate to others.
Stage 1: In this stage, which I refer to as 
emotional slavery
, we
believe ourselves responsible for the feelings of others. We think

we must constantly strive to keep everyone happy. If they donÕt

appear happy, we feel responsible and compelled to do something

about it. This can easily lead us to see the very people who are

closest to us as burdens. 
Taking responsibility for the feelings of others can be very
detrimental in intimate relationships. I routinely hear variations on

the following theme: ÒIÕm really scared to be in a relationship.

Every time I see my partner in pain or needing
something, I feel overwhelmed. I feel like IÕm

in prison, that IÕm being smotheredÑand I

just have to get out of the relationship as

fast as possible.Ó This response is common

among those who experience love as denial
of oneÕs own needs in order to attend to the needs of the beloved.

In the early days of a relationship, partners typically relate joyfully

and compassionately to each other out of a sense of freedom. The

relationship is exhilarating, spontaneous, wonderful. Eventually,

however, as the relationship becomes Òserious,Ó partners may begin

to assume responsibility for each otherÕs feelings. 
If I were a partner who is conscious of doing this, I might
acknowledge the situation by explaining, ÒI canÕt bear it when I lose

myself in relationships. When I see my partnerÕs pain, I lose me, and

then I just have to break free.Ó However, if I have not reached this

level of awareness, I am likely to blame my partner for the

deterioration of the relationship. Thus I might say, ÒMy partner is so

needy and dependent itÕs really stressing out our relationship.Ó In

such a case, my partner would do well to reject the notion that there

is anything wrong with her needs. It would only make a bad

situation worse to accept that blame. Instead, she could offer an

empathic response to address the pain of my emotional slavery: ÒSo

you find yourself in panic. ItÕs very hard for you to hold on to the

deep caring and love weÕve had without turning it into a

responsibility, duty, obligation. . . . You sense your freedom closing

down because you think you constantly have to take care of me.Ó If,

however, instead of an empathic response, she says, ÒAre you feeling

tense because I have been making too many demands on you?Ó then

both of us are likely to stay enmeshed in emotional slavery, making

it that much more difficult for the relationship to survive. 
Stage 2: In this stage, we become aware of the high costs of
assuming responsibility for othersÕ feelings and trying to

accommodate them at our own expense. When we notice how much

of our lives weÕve missed and how little we have responded to the

call of our own soul, we may get
angry. I refer jokingly to this stage

as the 
obnoxious stage 
because we
tend toward obnoxious comments

like, ÒThatÕs 
your
problem! 
IÕm
not
responsible for your feelings!Ó when

presented with another personÕs pain. We are clear what we are not

responsible 
for
, but have yet to learn how to be responsible 
to
others in a way that is not emotionally enslaving. 
As we emerge from the stage of emotional enslavement, we
may continue to carry remnants of fear and guilt around having

our own needs. Thus it is not surprising that we end up expressing

those needs in ways that sound rigid and unyielding to the ears of

others. For example, during a break in one of my workshops, a

young woman expressed appreciation for the insights sheÕd gained

into her own state of emotional enslavement. When the workshop

resumed, I suggested an activity to the group. The same young

woman then declared assertively, ÒIÕd rather do something else.Ó I

sensed she was exercising her newfound right to express her

needsÑeven if they ran counter to those of others. 
To encourage her to sort out what she wanted, I asked, ÒDo you
want to do something else even if it conflicts with my needs?Ó She

thought for a moment, and then stammered, ÒYes. . . . er . . . I mean

no.Ó Her confusion reflects how, in the obnoxious stage, we have

yet to grasp that emotional liberation entails more than simply

asserting our own needs. 
I recall an incident during my daughter MarlaÕs passage
toward emotional liberation. She had always been the Òperfect

little girlÓ who denied her own needs to comply with the wishes

of others. When I became aware of how frequently she suppressed

her own desires in order to please others, I talked to her about how

IÕd enjoy hearing her express her needs more often. When we first

broached the subject, Marla cried. ÒBut, Daddy, I donÕt want to

disappoint anybody!Ó she protested helplessly. I tried to show

Marla how her honesty would be a gift more precious to others

than accommodating them to prevent their upset. I also clarified
ways she could empathize with people when they were upset

without taking responsibility for their feelings. 
A short time later, I saw evidence that my daughter was
beginning to express her needs more openly. A call came from her

school principal, apparently disturbed by a communication heÕd

had with Marla, who had arrived at school wearing overalls.

ÒMarla,Ó heÕd said, Òyoung women do not dress this way.Ó To which

Marla had responded, ÒF___ off!Ó Hearing this was cause for

celebration: Marla had graduated from emotional slavery to

obnoxiousness! She was learning to express her needs and risk

dealing with the displeasure of others. Surely she had yet to assert

her needs comfortably and in a way that respected the needs of

others, but I trusted this would occur in time. 
Stage 3: At the third stage, 
emotional liberation
, we respond to
the needs of others out of compassion, never out of fear, guilt, or

shame. Our actions are therefore fulfilling to us, as well as to those
who receive our efforts. We accept full

responsibility for our own intentions and

actions, but not for the feelings of others. At

this stage, we are aware that we can never

meet our own needs at the expense of

others. Emotional liberation involves stating
clearly what we need in a way that communicates we are equally

concerned that the needs of others be fulfilled. NVC is designed to

support us in relating at this level. 
Summary
The third component of NVC is the acknowledgment of the needs

behind our feelings. What others say and do may be the 
stimulus
,
but never the cause, of our feelings. When someone communicates

negatively, we have four options as to how to receive the message:

(1) blame ourselves, (2) blame others, (3) sense our own feelings

and needs, (4) sense the feelings and needs hidden in the other

personÕs negative message.

Third stage: Emotional

liberation: we take

responsibility for our

intentions and actions
Judgments, criticisms, diagnoses, and interpretations of others
are all alienated expressions of our own needs and values. When

others hear criticism, they tend to invest their energy in self-

defense or counterattack. The more directly we can connect our

feelings to our needs, the easier it is for others to respond

compassionately.
In a world where we are often harshly judged for identifying
and revealing our needs, doing so can be very frightening,

especially for women who are socialized to ignore their own needs

while caring for others. 
In the course of developing emotional responsibility, most of
us experience three stages: (1) Òemotional slaveryÓÑbelieving

ourselves responsible for the feelings of others, (2) Òthe obnoxious

stageÓÑin which we refuse to admit to caring what anyone else

feels or needs, and (3) Òemotional liberationÓÑin which we accept

full responsibility for our own feelings but not the feelings of

others, while being aware that we can never meet our own needs

at the expense of others.
NVC in Action
ÒBring back the stigma of illegitimacy!Ó
A student of Nonviolent Communication volunteering at
a food bank was shocked when an elderly co-worker bursts

out from behind a newspaper, ÒWhat we need to do in this

country is to bring back the stigma of illegitimacy!Ó 
The womanÕs habitual reaction to this kind of statement
would have been to say nothing, to judge the other severely

but silently, and eventually process her own feelings safely

away from the scene. This time she remembered she had the

option of listening for the feelings and needs behind the

words that had shocked her.

Co-worker:
Of course! Do you know, my father would

Woman:
So youÕre remembering how it was for the girls

Co-worker:
Sure thing! We knew what would happen to us

the time, not like these girls nowadays.

Well, at least fear and punishment worked! It
says here that there are girls sleeping around

with different men just so they can get

pregnant! ThatÕs right! They have babies and

The woman heard two different feelings in this statement:
astonishment that girls would deliberately get pregnant, and

annoyance that taxpayers end up paying for children born in

this way. She chose which feeling to empathize with.

The woman expressed herself in NVC, using all four
parts of the process:observation (O), feeling (F), need (N),

request (R). 
The dialogue continued with several more exchanges
until the woman got the reassurance she needed that her co-

worker did indeed offer caring and respectful help to

unmarried teen clients. Even more importantly, what the

woman gained was a new experience in expressing

disagreement in a way that met her needs for honesty and

mutual respect. 
In the meantime, the co-worker left satisfied that her
concerns around teen pregnancy had been fully heard. Both

parties felt understood and their relationship benefited from

their having shared their understanding and differences

without hostility. In the absence of NVC, their relationship

might have begun to deteriorate from this moment, and the

work they both wanted to do in commonÑtaking care and

helping peopleÑmight have suffered.

ACKNOWLEDGING NEEDS 
To practice identifying needs, please circle the number in front of
any statement whereby the speaker is acknowledging responsibility

for his or her feelings.
1.ÒYou irritate me when you leave company documents on the
conference room floor.Ó
2.ÒI feel angry when you say that, because I am wanting respect

3.ÒI feel frustrated when you come late.Ó

4.ÒIÕm sad that you wonÕt be coming for dinner because I was

5.ÒI feel disappointed because you said you would do it and
you didnÕt.Ó
6.ÒIÕm discouraged because I would have liked to have
progressed further in my work by now.Ó
7.ÒLittle things people say sometimes hurt me.Ó

8.ÒI feel happy that you received that award.Ó

10.ÒI am grateful that you offered me a ride because I was
needing to get home before my children.Ó
Here are my responses for Exercise 3:
1.If you circled this number, weÕre not in agreement. To me, the
statement implies that the other personÕs behavior is solely

responsible for the speakerÕs feelings. It doesnÕt reveal the

speakerÕs needs or thoughts that are contributing to his or

her feelings. To do so, the speaker might have said, ÒIÕm

irritated when you leave company documents on the

CHAPTER SIX
Req uesting That Which
Would Enrich Life
W
e have now covered the first three components of NVC that
address what we are 
observing
, 
feeling
, and 
needing
. We have
learned to do this without criticizing, analyzing, blaming, or

diagnosing others, and in a way most likely to inspire compassion.

The fourth and final component of this process addresses the

question of 
what we would like to request of others
in order to
enrich life for us. When our needs are not being fulfilled, we follow

the expression of what we are observing, feeling, and needing with

a specific request: we ask for actions that might fulfill our needs.

How do we express our requests so that others are more willing to

respond compassionately to our needs? 
Using Positive Action Language 
First of all, we express what we 
are
requesting rather than what we 
are not
requesting. ÒHow do you do a 
donÕt
?Ó
goes a line of a childrenÕs song by my 

colleague, Ruth Bebermeyer, ÒAll I know is I feel 
wonÕt
when IÕm
told to do a 
donÕt
.Ó These lyrics reveal two problems commonly
encountered when requests are worded in the negative. People

are often confused as to what is actually being requested, and

furthermore, negative requests are likely to provoke resistance. 
A woman at a workshop, frustrated that her husband was
spending so much time at work, described how her request had

backfired: ÒI asked him not to spend so much time at work. Three
weeks later, he responded by announcing that heÕd signed up for a

golf tournament!Ó She had successfully communicated to him what

she did not wantÑhis spending so much time at workÑbut had

failed to request what she 
did
want. Encouraged to reword her
request, she thought a minute and said, ÒI wish I had told him that

I would like him to spend at least one evening a week at home with

the children and me.Ó
During the Vietnam War, I was asked to debate the war issue on
television with a man whose position differed from mine. The show

was videotaped, so I was able to watch it at home that evening. When

I saw myself on the screen communicating in ways I didnÕt want

to be communicating, I felt very upset. ÒIf IÕm ever in another

discussion,Ó I told myself, ÒI am determined not to do what I did on

that program! IÕm not going to be defensive. IÕm not going to let them

make a fool of me.Ó Notice how I spoke to myself in terms of what I

didnÕt
want to do rather than in terms of what I 
did
want to do.
A chance to redeem myself came the very next week when I was
invited to continue the debate on the same program. All the way to

the studio, I repeated to myself all the things I didnÕt want to do. As

soon as the program started, the man launched off in exactly the

same way as he had a week earlier. For about ten seconds after heÕd

finished talking, I managed not to communicate in the ways I had

been reminding myself. In fact, I said nothing. I just sat there. As

soon as I opened my mouth, however, I found words tumbling out

in all the ways I had been so determined to avoid! It was a painful

lesson about what can happen when I only identify what I 
donÕt
want to do, without clarifying what I 
do 
want to do. 
I was once invited to work with some high school students
who suffered a long litany of grievances against their principal.

They regarded the principal as a racist, and searched for ways to

get even with him. A minister who worked closely with the young

people became deeply concerned over the prospect of violence. Out

of respect for the minister, the students agreed to meet with me. 
They began by describing what they saw as discrimination on
N

¥
the part of the principal. After listening to several of their charges,
I suggested that they proceed by clarifying what they wanted from

the principal. 
ÒWhat good would that do?Ó scoffed one student in disgust,
ÒWe already went to him to tell him what we wanted. His answer

to us was, ÔGet out of here! I donÕt need you people telling me what

to do!ÕÓ
I asked the students what they had requested of the principal.
They recalled saying to him that they didnÕt want him telling them

how to wear their hair. I suggested that they might have received

a more cooperative response if they had expressed what they 
did
,
rather than what they 
did not
, want. They had then informed the
principal that they wanted to be treated with fairness, at which he

had become defensive, vociferously denying ever having been

unfair. I ventured to guess that the principal would have responded

more favorably if they had asked for specific actions rather than

vague behavior like Òfair treatment.Ó 
Working together, we found ways to express their requests in
positive action language. At the end of the meeting, the students had

clarified 38 actions they wanted the principal to take, including

ÒWeÕd like you to agree to black student representation on decisions

made about dress code,Ó and ÒWeÕd like you to refer to us as Ôblack

studentsÕ and not Ôyou people.ÕÓ The following day, the students

presented their requests to the principal using the positive action

language we had practiced; that evening I received an elated phone

call from them: their principal had agreed to all 38 requests! 
In addition to using positive language, we also want to avoid
vague, abstract, or ambiguous phrasing and to word our requests

in the form of concrete actions that others can undertake. A

cartoon depicts a man who has fallen into a lake. As he struggles

to swim, he shouts to his dog on shore, ÒLassie, get help!Ó In the

next frame, the dog is lying on a psychiatristÕs couch. We all

know how opinions vary as to what constitutes ÒhelpÓ: some

members of my family, when asked to help with the dishes, think

ÒhelpÓ means supervision.

A couple in distress attending a workshop provides an
additional illustration of how nonspecific language can hamper

understanding and communication. ÒI want you to let me be me,Ó

the woman declared to her husband. ÒI do!Ó he retorted. ÒNo, you

donÕt!Ó she insisted. Asked to express herself in positive action

language, the woman replied, ÒI want you to give me the freedom
to grow and be myself.Ó Such a statement,

however, is just as vague and likely to

provoke a defensive response. She struggled

to formulate her request clearly, and then

admitted, ÒItÕs kind of awkward, but if I

were to be precise, I guess what I want is
for you to smile and say that anything I do is okay.Ó Often, the

use of vague and abstract language can mask such oppressive

interpersonal games.
A similar lack of clarity occurred between a father and his 15-
year-old son when they came in for counseling. ÒAll I want is for you

to start showing a little responsibility,Ó claimed the father. ÒIs that

asking too much?Ó I suggested that he specify what it would take for

his son to demonstrate the responsibility he was seeking. After a

discussion on how to clarify his request, the father responded

sheepishly, ÒWell, it doesnÕt sound so good, but when I say that I want

responsibility, what I really mean is that I want him to do what I ask,

without questionÑto jump when I say jump, and to smile while doing

it.Ó He then agreed with me that if his son were to actually behave

this way, it would demonstrate obedience rather than responsibility. 
Like this father, we often use vague and abstract language to
indicate how we want other people to feel or be without naming

a concrete action they can take to reach that state. For example,

an employer makes a genuine effort to invite feedback, telling
the employees, ÒI want you to feel free to

express yourself around me.Ó The statement

communicates the employerÕs desire for the

employees to Òfeel free,Ó but not what they could

do in order to feel this way. Instead, the employer

could use positive action language to make a request: ÒIÕd like you
to 
tell
me what I might 
do
to make it easier for you to feel free to
express yourselves around me.Ó 
As a final illustration of how the use of
vague language contributes to internal confu-

sion, I would like to present a conversation that

I would invariably have during my practice as a

clinical psychologist with the many clients who came to me with

complaints of depression. After I empathized with the depth of

feelings that a client had just expressed, our exchanges would

typically proceed in the following manner: 
MBR:
ÒWhat are you wanting that you are not receiving?Ó 
Client:
ÒI donÕt know what I want.Ó
MBR:
ÒI guessed that you would say that.Ó
Client:
ÒWhy?Ó
MBR:
ÒMy theory is that we get depressed because weÕre not
getting what we want, and weÕre not getting what we

want because we have never been taught to get what

we want. Instead, weÕve been taught to be good little

boys and girls and good mothers and fathers. If weÕre

going to be one of those good things, better get used to

being depressed. Depression is the reward we get for

being Ôgood.Õ But, if you want to feel better, IÕd like you

to clarify what you would like people to do to make life

more wonderful for you.Ó
Client:
ÒI just want someone to love me. ThatÕs hardly unrea-
sonable, is it?Ó
MBR:
ÒItÕs a good start. Now IÕd like you to clarify what you
would like people to do that would fulfill your need to

be loved. For example, what could I do right now?Ó
Client:
ÒOh, you know . . . Ó
MBR:
ÒIÕm not sure I do. IÕd like you to tell me what you would
like me, or others, to do to give you the love youÕre

looking for.Ó

MBR:
ÒYes, it can be difficult to make clear requests. But think
how hard it will be for others to respond to our request

if weÕre not even clear what it is!Ó
Client:
ÒIÕm starting to get clear what I want from others to
fulfill my need for love, but itÕs embarrassing.Ó
MBR:
ÒYes, very often it is embarrassing. So what would you
like for me or others to do?Ó 
Client:
ÒIf I really reflect upon what IÕm requesting when I ask
to be loved, I suppose I want you to guess what I want

before IÕm even aware of it. And then I want you to

always do it.Ó
MBR:
ÒIÕm grateful for your clarity. I hope you can see how
you are not likely to find someone who can fulfill your

need for love if thatÕs what it takes.Ó
Very often, my clients were able to see how the lack of awareness
of what they wanted from others had contributed significantly to

their frustrations and depression. 
Making Requests Consciously
Sometimes we may be able to communicate a clear request without

putting it in words. Suppose youÕre in the kitchen and your sister,

who is watching television in the living room, calls out, ÒIÕm

thirsty.Ó In this case, it may be obvious that she is requesting you

to bring her a glass of water from the kitchen.
However, in other instances, we may express our discomfort
and incorrectly assume that the listener has understood the

underlying request. For example, a woman might say to her
husband, ÒIÕm annoyed you forgot the

butter and onions I asked you to pick

up for dinner.Ó While it may be

obvious to her that she is asking him

to go back to the store, the husband

may think that her words were uttered

solely to make him feel guilty. 
Even more often, we are simply not
conscious of what we are requesting when

we speak. We talk 
to
others or 
at
them
without knowing how to engage in a

dialogue 
with
them. We toss out words, using the presence of others
as a wastebasket. In such situations, the listener, unable to discern

a clear request in the speakerÕs words, may experience the kind of

distress illustrated in the following anecdote. 
I was seated directly across the aisle from a couple on a mini-
train that carries passengers to their respective terminals at the

Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. For passengers in a hurry to catch a

plane, the snailÕs pace of the train may well be irritating. The man

turned to his wife and said with intensity, ÒI have never seen a train

go so slow in all my life!Ó She said nothing, appearing tense and

uneasy as to what response he might be expecting from her. He then

did what many of us do when weÕre not getting the response we

want: he repeated himself. In a markedly stronger voice, he

exclaimed, ÒI have never seen a train go so slow in all my life!Ó 
The wife, at a loss for response, looked even more distressed. In
desperation, she turned to him and said, ÒTheyÕre electronically

timed.Ó I didnÕt think this piece of information would satisfy him,

and indeed it did not, for he repeated himself a third timeÑeven

more loudly, Ò
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A TRAIN GO SO SLOW IN
ALL MY LIFE
!Ó The wifeÕs patience was clearly exhausted as she
snapped back angrily, ÒWell, what do you want me to do about it?

Get out and push?Ó Now there were two people in pain! 
What response was the man wanting? I believe he wanted to
hear that his pain was understood. If his wife had known this, she

might have responded, ÒIt sounds like youÕre scared we might miss

our plane, and disgusted because youÕd

like a faster train running between these

terminals.Ó 
In the above exchange, the wife heard
the husbandÕs frustration but was clueless

as to what he was asking for. Equally problematic is the reverse
situationÑwhen people state their requests without first

communicating the feelings and needs behind them. This is

especially true when the request takes the form of a question. ÒWhy

donÕt you go and get a haircut?Ó can easily be heard by youngsters

as a demand or an attack unless parents remember to first reveal

their own feelings and needs: ÒWeÕre worried that your hair is

getting so long it might keep you from seeing things, especially

when youÕre on your bike. How about a haircut?Ó 
It is more common, however, for people to talk without being
conscious of what they are asking for. ÒIÕm

not requesting anything,Ó they might

remark, ÒI just felt like saying what I

said.Ó My belief is that, whenever we

say 
something to another person, we are
requesting something in return. It may
simply be an empathic connectionÑa verbal or nonverbal

acknowledgment, as with the man on the train, that our words

have been understood. Or we may be requesting honesty: we wish

to know the listenerÕs honest reaction to our words. Or we may be

requesting an action that we hope would fulfill our needs. The

clearer we are on what we want back from the other person, the

more likely it is that our needs will be met. 
Asking For A Reflection
As we know, the message we send is not always the message thatÕs

received. We generally rely on verbal cues to determine whether

our message has been understood to our satisfaction. If, however,

weÕre uncertain that it has been received as intended, we need to
be able to clearly request a response

that tells us how the message was heard

so as to be able to correct any 
mis-
understanding. On some occasions, a

simple question like, ÒIs that clear?Ó will

suffice. At other times, we need more

than ÒYes, I understood you,Ó to feel confident that weÕve been
truly understood. At such times, we might ask others to reflect

back in their own words what they heard us say. We then have the

opportunity to restate parts of our message to address any

discrepancy or omission we might have noticed in their reflection.
For example, a teacher approaches a student and says, ÒPeter, I
got concerned when I checked my record book yesterday. I want to

make sure youÕre aware of the homework IÕm missing from you.

Will you drop by my office after school?Ó Peter mumbles, ÒOkay, I

knowÓ and then turns away, leaving the teacher uneasy as to

whether her message had been accurately received. She asks for a

reflectionÑÒCould you tell me what you just heard me say?ÓÑto

which Peter replies, ÒYou said I gotta miss soccer to stay after

school because you didnÕt like my homework.Ó Confirmed in her

suspicion that Peter had not heard her intended message, the

teacher tries to restate it, but first she is

careful of her next remark.
An assertion like ÒYou didnÕt hear me,Ó
ÒThatÕs not what I said,Ó or ÒYouÕre mis-

understanding me,Ó may easily lead Peter

to think that he is being chastised. Since

the teacher perceives Peter as having sincerely responded to her

request for a reflection, she might say, ÒIÕm grateful to you for

telling me what you heard. I can see that I didnÕt make myself as

clear as IÕd have liked, so let me try again.Ó
When we first begin asking others to reflect back what they
hear us say, it may feel awkward and strange because such requests

are rarely made. When I emphasize the importance of our ability

to ask for reflections, people often express reservations. They are

worried about reactions like, ÒWhat do you think I amÑdeaf?Ó or

ÒQuit playing your psychological games.Ó To

prevent such responses, we can explain to

people ahead of time why we may sometimes

ask them to reflect back our words. We make

clear that weÕre not testing their listening

Requesting Honesty
After weÕve openly expressed ourselves and received the under-

standing we want, weÕre often eager to know the other personÕs

reaction to what weÕve said. Usually the honesty we would like to

receive takes one of three directions:
¥ 
Sometimes weÕd like to know the
feelings that are stimulated by what we

said, and the reasons for those feelings.

We might request this by asking, ÒI

would like you to tell me how you feel

about what I just said, and your

reasons for feeling as you do.Ó
¥
Sometimes weÕd like to know something about our listenerÕs
thoughts in response to what they just heard us say. At these

times, itÕs important to specify which thoughts weÕd like

them to share. For example, we might say, ÒIÕd like you to tell

me if you predict that my proposal would be successful, and
if not, what you believe would prevent its

success,Ó rather than simply saying, ÒIÕd like

you to tell me what you think about what

IÕve said.Ó When we donÕt specify which
thoughts we would like to receive, the other person may

respond at great length with thoughts that arenÕt the ones we

are seeking. 
¥
Sometimes weÕd like to know whether the person is willing to
take certain actions that weÕve recommended. Such a request

After we express

ourselves vulnerably,

we often want to know 

(a) what the listener 

is feeling;
(b) what the listener 

is thinking; or
may sound like this: ÒIÕd like you to
tell me if you would be willing to

postpone our meeting for one week.Ó
The use of NVC requires that we be
conscious of the specific form of honesty we would like to receive,

and to make that request for honesty in concrete language. 
Making Requests Of A Group
It is especially important when we are addressing a group to be

clear about the kind of understanding or honesty we want back

from them after weÕve expressed ourselves. When we are not clear

about the response weÕd like, we may initiate unproductive

conversations that end up satisfying no oneÕs needs. 
IÕve been invited from time to time to work with groups of
citizens concerned about racism in their communities. One issue that

frequently arises among these groups is that their meetings are

tedious and fruitless. This lack of productivity is very costly for

the members, who often expend limited resources to arrange for

transportation and childcare in order to attend meetings. Frustrated

by prolonged discussions that yield little direction, many members

quit the groups, declaring meetings a waste of time. Furthermore, the

institutional changes they are striving to make are not usually ones

that occur quickly or easily. For all these reasons, when such groups

do meet, itÕs important that they make good use of their time together. 
I knew members of one such group that had been organized to
effect change in the local school system. It was their belief that

various elements in the school system discriminated against students

on the basis of race. Because their meetings were unproductive and

the group was losing members, they invited me to observe their

discussions. I suggested that they conduct their meeting as usual,

and that I would let them know if I saw any ways NVC might help. 
One man began the meeting by calling the groupÕs attention to
a recent newspaper article in which a minority mother had raised

complaints and concerns regarding the principalÕs treatment of her
daughter. A woman responded by sharing a situation that had

occurred to her when she was a student at the same school. One by

one, each member then related a similar personal experience. After

twenty minutes I asked the group if their needs were being met by

the current discussion. Not one person said Òyes.Ó ÒThis is what

happens all the time in these meetings!Ó huffed one man, ÒI have

better things to do with my time than sit around listening to the

same old bullshit.Ó
I then addressed the man who had initiated the discussion:
ÒCan you tell me, when you brought up the newspaper article, what

response you were wanting from the group?Ó ÒI thought it was

interesting,Ó he replied. I explained that I was asking what response
he wanted from the group, rather than

what he thought about the article. He

pondered awhile and then conceded, ÒIÕm

not sure what I wanted.Ó
And thatÕs why, I believe, twenty
minutes of the groupÕs valuable time had

been squandered on fruitless discourse.
When we address a group without being clear what we are wanting

back, unproductive discussions will often follow. However, if even

one member of a group is conscious of the importance of clearly

requesting the response that is desired, he or she can extend this

consciousness to the group. For example, when this particular man

didnÕt define what response he wanted, a member of the group might

have said, ÒIÕm confused about how youÕd like us to respond to your

story. Would you be willing to say what response youÕd like from us?Ó

Such interventions can prevent the waste of precious group time. 
Conversations often drag on and on, fulfilling no oneÕs needs,
because it is unclear whether the initiator of the conversation has

gotten what she or he wanted. In India, when people have received

the response they want in conversations they have initiated, they

say ÒbasÓ (pronounced bus). This means, ÒYou need not say more.

I feel satisfied and am now ready to move on to something else.Ó

In a group, much time

is wasted when

speakers arenÕt certain

what response theyÕre

wanting back.
Though we lack such a word in our own language, we can benefit
from developing and promoting Òbas-consciousnessÓ in all our

interactions. 
Requests Versus Demands
Requests are received as demands when

others believe they will be blamed or

punished if they do not comply. When

people hear us make a demand, they see only two options:

submission or rebellion. Either way, the person requesting is

perceived as coercive, and the listenerÕs capacity to respond

compassionately to the request is diminished. 
The more we have in the past blamed, punished, or Òlaid guilt
tripsÓ on others when they havenÕt responded to our requests, the

higher the likelihood that our requests will now be heard as

demands. We also pay for the use of

such tactics by others. To the degree

that people in our lives have been

blamed, punished, or urged to feel

guilty for not doing what others have

requested, the more likely they are to

carry this baggage to every subsequent

relationship and hear a demand in any request. 
LetÕs look at two variations of a situation. Jack says to his
friend Jane, ÒIÕm lonely and would like you to spend the evening

with me.Ó Is that a request or a demand?

The answer is that we donÕt know until we

observe how Jack treats Jane if she doesnÕt

comply. Suppose she replies, ÒJack, IÕm

really tired. If youÕd like some company,

how about finding someone else to be with you this evening?Ó If

Jack then remarks, ÒHow typical of you to be so selfish!Ó his

request was in fact a demand. Instead of empathizing with her

need to rest, he has blamed her.

When the other person

hears a demand from us,

they see two options:

submit or rebel. 
How to tell if itÕs a

demand or a request:

Observe what the speaker

does if the request is not

complied with.
ItÕs a demand if the

speaker then criticizes

or judges.
Consider a second scenario:
Jack:
ÒIÕm lonely and would like you to spend the evening
with me.Ó
Jane:
ÒJack, IÕm really tired. If youÕd like some company, how
about finding someone else to be with you tonight?Ó
Jack turns away wordlessly.

Jane, sensing he is upset:
ÒIs something bothering you?Ó
Jack:
ÒNo.Ó
Jane:
ÒCome on, Jack, I can sense somethingÕs going on.
WhatÕs the matter?Ó
Jack:
ÒYou know how lonely IÕm feeling. If you really loved
me, youÕd spend the evening with me.Ó
Again, instead of empathizing, Jack now
interprets JaneÕs response to mean that she

doesnÕt love him and that she has rejected him.

The more we interpret noncompliance as

rejection, the more likely our requests will be
heard as demands. This leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy, for the

more people hear demands, the less they enjoy being around us. 
On the other hand, we would know that JackÕs request had
been a genuine request, not a demand, if his response to Jane

had expressed a respectful recognition of her feelings and needs,

e.g. ÒSo, Jane, youÕre feeling worn out and needing some rest

this evening?Ó
We can help others trust that we are requesting, not
demanding, by indicating that we would only want the person to

comply if he or she can do so willingly. Thus we might ask, ÒWould

you be willing to set the table?Ó rather than ÒI would like you to
set the table.Ó However, the most powerful

way to communicate that we are making a

genuine request is to empathize with people

when they donÕt respond to the request. We

demonstrate that we are making a request

rather than a demand by how we respond

when others donÕt comply. If we are prepared to show an empathic
understanding of what prevents someone from doing as we asked,

then by my definition, we have made a request, not a demand.

Choosing to request rather than demand does not mean we give up

when someone says ÒnoÓ to our request. It does mean that we donÕt

engage in persuasion until we have empathized with whatÕs

preventing the other person from saying Òyes.Ó
Defining Our Objective When Making Requests
Expressing genuine requests also requires an awareness of our

objective. If our objective is only to change people and their

behavior or to get our way, then NVC is not an appropriate tool.

The process is designed for those

of us who would like others to

change and respond, but only if

they choose to do so willingly and

compassionately. The objective of NVC is to establish a relationship

based on honesty and empathy. When others trust that our primary

commitment is to the quality of the relationship, and that we

expect this process to fulfill everyoneÕs needs, then they can trust

that our requests are true requests and not camouflaged demands.
A consciousness of this objective is difficult to maintain,
especially for parents, teachers, managers, and others whose work

centers around influencing people and obtaining behavioral

results. A mother who once returned to a workshop after lunch

break announced, ÒMarshall, I went home and tried it. It didnÕt

work.Ó I asked her to describe what sheÕd done.
ÒI went home and expressed my feelings and needs, just as weÕd
practiced. I made no criticism, no judgments of my son. I simply said,

ÔLook, when I see that you havenÕt done the work you said you were

going to do, I feel very disappointed. I wanted to be able to come home

and find the house in order and your chores completed.Õ Then I made

a request: I told him I wanted him to clean it up immediately.Ó
ÒIt sounds like you clearly expressed all the components,Ó I
commented, ÒWhat happened?Ó

Our objective is a relationship

based on honesty and empathy.
ÒHe didnÕt do it.Ó
ÒThen what happened?Ó I asked.

ÒI told him he couldnÕt go through life being lazy and
irresponsible.Ó
I could see that this woman was not yet able to distinguish
between expressing requests and making demands. She was still

defining the process as successful only if she got compliance for

her Òrequests.Ó During the initial phases of learning this process,

we may find ourselves applying the components of NVC

mechanically without awareness of the underlying purpose. 
Sometimes, however, even when weÕre conscious of our intent
and express our request with care, some people may still hear a

demand. This is particularly true when we occupy positions of

authority and are speaking with those who have had past

experiences with coercive authority figures. 
Once, the administrator of a high school invited me to demonstrate
to teachers how NVC might be helpful in communicating with

students who werenÕt cooperating as the teachers would have liked. 
I was asked to meet with forty students who had been deemed
Òsocially and emotionally maladjusted.Ó I was struck by the way

such labels serve as self-fulfilling prophecies. If you were a student

who had been thus labeled, wouldnÕt it just give you permission to

have some fun at school by resisting whatever was asked of you?

By giving people labels, we tend to act toward them in a way that

contributes to the very behavior that concerns us, which we then

view as further confirmation of our diagnosis. Since these students

knew they had been classified as Òsocially and emotionally

maladjusted,Ó I wasnÕt surprised that, when I walked in, most of

them were hanging out the window hollering obscenities at their

friends in the courtyard below. I began by making a request: ÒIÕd

like you all to come over and sit down so I can tell you who I am

and what IÕd like us to do today.Ó About half the students came

over. Uncertain that they had all heard me, I repeated my request.

With that, the remainder of the students sat down, with the exception

of two young men who remained draped over the 
windowsill.

Unfortunately for me, these two were the biggest students in the class.
ÒExcuse me,Ó I addressed them, Òwould one of you two gentlemen
tell me what you heard me say?Ó One of them turned toward me and

snorted, ÒYeah, you said we had to go over there and sit down.Ó I

thought to myself, ÒUh, oh, heÕs heard my request as a demand.Ó
Out loud I said, ÒSirÓ (IÕve learned always to say ÒsirÓ to people
with biceps like his, especially when one of them sports a tattoo),

Òwould you be willing to tell me how I could have let you know

what I was wanting so that it wouldnÕt sound like I was bossing

you around?Ó ÒHuh?Ó Having been conditioned to expect demands

from authorities, he was not used to my different approach. ÒHow

can I let you know what IÕm wanting from you so it doesnÕt sound

like I donÕt care about what youÕd like?Ó I repeated. He hesitated for

a moment and shrugged, ÒI donÕt know.Ó 
ÒWhatÕs going on between you and me right now is a good
example of what I was wanting us to talk about today. I believe

people can enjoy each other a lot better if they can say what they

would like without bossing others around. When I tell you what IÕd

like, IÕm not saying that you have to do it or IÕll try to make your

life miserable. I donÕt know how to say that in a way that you can

trust.Ó To my relief, this seemed to make sense to the young man

who, together with his friend, sauntered over to join the group. In

certain situations such as this one, it may take awhile for our

requests to be clearly seen for what they are.
When making a request, it is also helpful to scan our minds
for thoughts of the following sort that automatically transform

requests into demands:
¥
He 
should
be cleaning up after himself.
¥
SheÕs 
supposed
to do what I ask.
¥
I 
deserve
to get a raise.

IÕm

thoughts in my mind once when my younger son was not taking
out the garbage. When we were dividing the household chores, he

had agreed to this task, but every day we would have another

struggle about getting the garbage out. Every day I would remind

himÑÒThis is your job,Ó ÒWe all have jobs,Ó etc.Ñwith the sole

objective of getting him to take out the garbage. 
Finally, one night I listened more closely to what heÕd been
telling me all along about why the garbage wasnÕt going out. I

wrote the following song after that eveningÕs discussion. After my

son felt my empathy for his position, he began taking out the

garbage without any further reminder from me. 
Song from Brett
If I clearly understand

you intend no demand,

IÕll usually respond when you call.

But if you come across 

like a high and mighty boss,

youÕll feel like you ran into a wall.

And when you remind me

about all those things youÕve done for me,

youÕd better get ready:

Here comes another bout!

Then you can shout,

you can spit,

moan, groan, and throw a fit;

I still wonÕt take the garbage out.

Now even if you should change your style,

ItÕs going to take me a little while

before I can forgive and forget.

Summary
The fourth component of NVC addresses the question of 
what we
would like to request of each other to enrich each of our lives
. We
try to avoid vague, abstract, or ambiguous phrasing, and remember

to use positive action language by stating what we 
are
requesting
rather than what we are 
not
. 
When we speak, the clearer we are about what we want back,
the more likely we are to get it. Since the message we send is not

always the message thatÕs received, we need to learn how to find

out if our message has been accurately heard. Especially when we

are expressing ourselves in a group, we need to be clear about the

nature of the response we are wanting back. Otherwise we may

be initiating unproductive conversations that waste considerable

group time. 
Requests are received as demands when listeners believe that
they will be blamed or punished if they do not comply. We can help

others trust that we are requesting, not demanding, by indicating

our desire for them to comply only if they can do so willingly. The

objective of NVC is not to change people and their behavior in

order to get our way; it is to establish relationships based on

honesty and empathy that will eventually fulfill everyoneÕs needs.

Yeah, I guess thatÕs it. . . . You know, I donÕt think IÕve

me to quit, I just tell them to get lost. IÕd like to quit,

Exercise 4
EXPRESSING REQUESTS 
To see whether weÕre in agreement about the clear expression of
requests, circle the number in front of any of the following

statements in which the speaker is clearly requesting that a specific

action be taken.
1.ÒI want you to understand me.Ó
2. ÒIÕd like you to tell me one thing that I did that you appreciate.Ó

3.ÒIÕd like you to feel more confidence in yourself.Ó

4.ÒI want you to stop drinking.Ó

5.ÒIÕd like you to let me be me.Ó

6.ÒIÕd like you to be honest with me about yesterdayÕs meeting.Ó

7.ÒI would like you to drive at or below the speed limit.Ó

8.ÒIÕd like to get to know you better.Ó

9.ÒI would like you to show respect for my privacy.Ó
10.ÒIÕd like you to prepare supper more often.Ó
Here are my responses for Exercise 4:
1.If you circled this number, weÕre not in agreement. To me, the
word ÒunderstandÓ does not clearly express a specific action

being requested. Instead, the speaker might have said, ÒI want

you to tell me what you heard me say.Ó
2.If you circled this number, weÕre in agreement that the
statement clearly expresses what the speaker is requesting. 
3.If you circled this number, weÕre not in agreement. To me, the
words Òfeel more confidenceÓ do not clearly express a specific

action being requested. The speaker might have said, ÒIÕd like

you to take a course in assertiveness training, which I believe

would increase your self-confidence.Ó

tell me you wonÕt leave our relationshipÑeven if I do some

things that you donÕt like.Ó
6.If you circled this number, weÕre not in agreement. To me, the

words Òshow respect for my privacyÓ do not clearly express a

specific action being requested. The speaker might have said,

ÒIÕd like you to agree to knock before you enter my office.Ó

CHAPTER SEVEN
Receiving E mpathically
T
he last four chapters describe the four
components of NVC: what we are
observing, feeling, and needing, and what

we wish to request to enrich our lives.

Now we turn from self-expression to apply

these same four components to hearing what others are observing,

feeling, needing, and requesting. We refer to this part of the

communication process as Òreceiving empathically.Ó
Presence: DonÕt Just Do Something, Stand There
Empathy is a respectful understanding of what others are

experiencing. The Chinese philosopher Chuang-Tzu stated that true

empathy requires listening with the whole

being: ÒThe hearing that is only in the

ears is one thing. The hearing of the

understanding is another. But the hearing

of the spirit is not limited to any one

faculty, to the ear, or to the mind. Hence it demands the emptiness

of all the faculties. And when the faculties are empty, then the

whole being listens. There is then a direct grasp of what is right

there before you that can never be heard with the ear or

understood with the mind.Ó
In relating to others, empathy occurs only when we have
successfully shed all preconceived ideas and judgments about them.

The Austrian-born Israeli philosopher Martin Buber describes this

quality of presence that life demands of us: ÒIn spite of all similarities,
The two parts of NVC:

Ñexpressing honestly

Ñreceiving empathically
Empathy: emptying the

mind and listening with

our whole being
¥
91
¥
every living situation has, like a newborn child, a new face, that has
never been before and will never come again. It demands of you a

reaction that cannot be prepared beforehand. It demands nothing of

what is past. It demands presence, responsibility; it demands you.Ó
The presence that empathy requires is not easy to maintain. ÒThe
capacity to give oneÕs attention to a sufferer is a very rare and diffi-

cult thing; it is almost a miracle; it is a miracle,Ó asserts French writer

Simone Weil. ÒNearly all those who think they have the capacity do

not possess it.Ó Instead of empathy, we tend instead to have a strong
urge to give advice or reassurance and to

explain our own position or feeling. Empathy,

on the other hand, requires focusing full

attention on the other personÕs message. We
give to others the time and space they need to express themselves

fully and to feel understood. There is a Buddhist saying that aptly

describes this ability: ÒDonÕt just do something, stand there.Ó 
It is often frustrating for someone needing empathy to have us
assume that they want reassurance or Òfix-itÓ advice. I received a

lesson from my daughter that taught me to check whether advice

or reassurance is wanted before offering any. She was looking in

the mirror one day and said, ÒIÕm as ugly as a pig.Ó 
ÒYouÕre the most gorgeous creature God ever put on the face
of the earth,Ó I declared. She shot me a look of exasperation,

exclaimed ÒOh, Daddy!Ó, and slammed the door as she left the

room. I later found out that she was wanting some empathy.

Instead of my ill-timed reassurance, I could have asked, ÒAre you

feeling disappointed with your appearance today?Ó 
My friend Holley Humphrey identified some common behaviors
that prevent us from being sufficiently present to connect empathi-

cally with others. The following are examples of such obstacles: 
¥
Advising: ÒI think you should . . . Ó ÒHow come you didnÕt . . . ?Ó

One-upping: ÒThatÕs nothing; waitÕll you hear what happened

In his book, 
When Bad Things Happen to Good People
, Rabbi
Harold Kushner describes how painful it was for him, when his son

was dying, to hear the words people offered that were intended to

make him feel better. Even more painful was his recognition that

for twenty years he had been saying the same things to other

people in similar situations! 
Believing we have to ÒfixÓ situations and make others feel better
prevents us from being present. Those of us in the role of counselor

or psychotherapist are particularly susceptible to this belief. Once,

when I was working with twenty-three mental health professionals,

I asked them to write, word for word, how they would respond to

a client who says, ÒIÕm feeling very depressed. I just donÕt see any

reason to go on.Ó I collected the answers they had written down

and announced, ÒI am now going to read out loud what each of

you wrote. Imagine yourself in the role of the person who

expressed the feeling of depression, and raise your hand after each

statement you hear that gives you a sense that youÕve been

understood.Ó Hands were raised to only three of the twenty-three

responses. Questions such as, ÒWhen did this begin?Ó constituted

the most frequent response; they give the appearance that the

professional is obtaining the information

necessary to diagnose and then treat the

problem. In fact, such intellectual

understanding of a problem blocks the

kind of presence that empathy requires. When we are thinking

about peopleÕs words, listening to how they connect to our theories,

we are looking at peopleÑwe are not 
with them. The 
key ingredient

Intellectual understand-
ing blocks empathy.
of empathy is 
presence: we are wholly present with the other party
and what they are experiencing. This quality of presence

distinguishes empathy from either mental understanding or

sympathy. While we may choose at times to sympathize with others

by feeling their feelings, itÕs helpful to be aware that during the

moment we are offering sympathy, we are not empathizing.
Listening For Feelings And Needs
In NVC, no matter what words people use to express themselves,

we listen for their observations, feelings, and needs, and what they

are requesting to enrich life. Imagine having loaned your car to

a new neighbor who had approached you with a personal
emergency. When your family finds out,

they react with intensity, ÒYou are a fool for

having trusted a total stranger!Ó The dialog

on the next page shows how to tune in to

the feelings and needs of the family

members in contrast to either (1) blaming

yourself by taking the message personally,
or (2) blaming and judging them. 
In this situation, itÕs obvious what the family is observing and
reacting to: the lending of the car to a relative stranger. In other

situations, it may not be so clear. If a colleague tells us, ÒYouÕre not

a good team player,Ó we may not know what he or she is

observing, although we can usually guess at the behavior that

might have triggered such a statement. 
The following exchange from a workshop demonstrates the
difficulty of focusing on other peopleÕs feelings and needs when we

are accustomed to assuming responsibility for their feelings and to

taking messages personally. The woman in this dialogue wanted to

learn to hear the feelings and needs behind certain of her

husbandÕs statements. I suggested that she guess at his feelings and

needs and then check it out with him.

Listen to what people

Paraphrasing
After we focus our attention and hear what others are observing,
feeling, and needing and what they are requesting to enrich their

lives, we may wish to reflect back by paraphrasing what we have

understood. In our previous discussion on requests (Chapter 6), we

discussed how to ask for a reflection; now we will look at how to

offer it to others.
If we have accurately received the other partyÕs message, our
paraphrasing will confirm this for them. If, on the other hand, our

paraphrase is incorrect, the speaker has an opportunity to correct

us. Another advantage of our choosing to reflect a message back

to the other party is that it offers them time to reflect on what

theyÕve said and an opportunity to delve deeper into themselves. 
NVC suggests that our paraphrasing take the form of questions
that reveal our understanding while eliciting any necessary

corrections from the speaker. Questions may focus on: 
A)what others are observing: ÒAre you reacting to how many
evenings I was gone last week?Ó 
B)how others are feeling and the needs generating their
feelings: ÒAre you feeling hurt because you would have

liked more appreciation of your efforts than you received?Ó
C)what others are requesting: ÒAre you wanting me to tell you
my reasons for saying what I did?Ó
These questions require us to sense whatÕs going on within
other people, while inviting their corrections should we have

sensed incorrectly. Notice the difference between these questions

and the ones below:
a)ÒWhat did I do that you are referring to?Ó
b)ÒHow are you feeling?Ó ÒWhy are you feeling that way?Ó

c)ÒWhat are you wanting me to do about it?Ó

This second set of questions asks for information without first
sensing the speakerÕs reality. Though they may appear to be the

most direct way to connect with whatÕs going on within the other

person, IÕve found that questions like

these are not the safest route to obtain the

information we seek. Many such ques-

tions may give speakers the impression

that weÕre a schoolteacher examining

them or a psychotherapist working on a case. If we do decide to ask

for information in this way, however, IÕve found that people feel

safer if we first reveal the feelings and needs within ourselves that

are generating the question. Thus, instead of asking someone ÒWhat

did I do?Ó we might say, ÒIÕm frustrated because IÕd like to be clearer

about what you are referring to. Would you be willing to tell me

what IÕve done that leads you to see me in this way?Ó While this

step may not be necessaryÑor even helpfulÑin situations where our

feelings and needs are clearly conveyed by the context or tone of

voice, I would recommend it particularly during moments when the

questions we ask are accompanied by strong emotions. 
How do we determine if an occasion calls for us to reflect
peopleÕs messages back to them? Certainly if we are unsure that

we have accurately understood the message, we might use

paraphrasing to elicit a correction to our guess. But even if we are

confident that weÕve understood them, we may sense the other

party wanting confirmation that their message has been accurately

received. They may even express this desire overtly by asking, ÒIs

that clear?Ó or ÒDo you understand what I mean?Ó At such

moments, hearing a clear paraphrase will often be more reassuring

to the speaker than hearing simply, ÒYes, I understand.Ó 
For example, shortly after participating in an NVC training, a
woman volunteer at a hospital was requested by some nurses to

talk to an elderly patient: ÒWeÕve told this woman she isnÕt that

sick and that sheÕd get better if she took her medicine, but all she

does is sit in her room all day long repeating, ÔI want to die. I want

to die.ÕÓ The volunteer approached the elderly woman, and as the

mation, first express our

nurses had predicted, found her sitting alone, whispering over and
over, ÒI want to die.Ó 
ÒSo you would like to die,Ó the volunteer empathized. Surprised,
the woman broke off her chant and appeared relieved. She began to

talk about how no one understood how terrible she was feeling. The

volunteer continued to reflect back the womanÕs feelings; before

long, such warmth had entered their dialogue that they were sitting

arms locked around each other. Later that day, the nurses questioned

the volunteer about her magic formula: the elderly woman had

started to eat and take her medicine, and was apparently in better

spirits. Although the nurses had tried to help her with advice and

reassurance, it wasnÕt until her interaction with the volunteer that

this woman received what she was truly needing: connection with

another human being who could hear her profound despair. 
There are no infallible guidelines regarding when to paraphrase,
but as a rule of thumb, it is safe to assume that speakers expressing
intensely emotional messages would

appreciate our reflecting these back to

them. When we ourselves are talking,

we can make it easier for the listener if
we clearly signify when we want or don't want our words to be

reflected back to us.
There are occasions when we may choose not to verbally reflect
someoneÕs statements out of respect for certain cultural norms. For

example, a Chinese man once attended a workshop to learn how to

hear the feelings and needs behind his fatherÕs remarks. Because he

could not bear the criticism and attack he continually heard in his

fatherÕs words, this man dreaded visiting his father and avoided him

for months at a time. He came to me ten years later and reported that
his ability to hear feelings and needs had

radically transformed his relationship with

his father to the point where they now

enjoy a close and loving connection.

Although he listens for his fatherÕs feelings

and needs, however, he does not paraphrase

what he hears. ÒI never say it out loud.Ó he explained, ÒIn our
culture, to direct-talk to a person about their feelings is something

theyÕre not used to. But thanks to the fact that I no longer hear

what he says as an attack, but as his own feelings and needs, our

relationship has become enormously wonderful.Ó 
ÒSo youÕre never going to talk directly to him about feelings,
but it helps to be able to hear them?Ó I asked.
ÒNo, now I think IÕm probably ready,Ó he answered. ÒNow that
we have such a solid relationship, if I were to say to him, ÔDad, IÕd

like to be able to talk directly to you about what we are feeling,Õ I

think he just might be ready to do it.Ó
When we paraphrase, the tone of voice we use is highly
important. When they hear themselves reflected back, people are

likely to be sensitive to the slightest hint of criticism or sarcasm.

They are likewise negatively affected by a declarative tone that

implies that we are telling them what is going on inside of them.

If we are consciously listening for other peopleÕs feelings and

needs, however, our tone communicates that weÕre asking whether

we have understoodÑnot claiming that we have understood. 
We also need to be prepared for the possibility that the
intention behind our paraphrasing will be misinterpreted. ÒDonÕt

pull any of that psychology crap on me!Ó we may be told. Should

this occur, we continue our effort to sense the speakerÕs feelings

and needs; perhaps we see in this case that the speaker doesnÕt trust

our motives and needs more understanding of our intentions

before he can appreciate hearing our paraphrases. As weÕve seen,

all criticism, attack, insults, and judgments vanish when we focus

attention on hearing the feelings and needs behind a message. The

more we practice in this way, the more we realize a simple truth:

behind all those messages weÕve allowed

ourselves to be intimidated by are just

individuals with unmet needs appealing to

us to contribute to their well-being. When

we receive messages with this awareness,

we never feel dehumanized by what others

have to say to us. We only feel
dehumanized when we get trapped in

derogatory images of other people or

thoughts of wrongness about ourselves.

As author and mythologist Joseph
Campbell suggested, ÒÔWhat will they think of me?Õ must be put

aside for bliss.Ó We begin to feel this bliss when messages

previously experienced as critical or blaming begin to be seen for

the gifts they are: opportunities to give to people who are in pain. 
If it happens regularly that people distrust our motives and
sincerity when we paraphrase their words, we may need to examine

our own intentions more closely. Perhaps we are paraphrasing and

engaging the components of NVC in a mechanistic way without

maintaining clear consciousness of purpose. We might ask

ourselves, for example, whether we are more intent on applying the

process ÒcorrectlyÓ than on connecting with the human being in

front of us. Or perhaps, even though we are using the form of NVC,

our only interest is in changing the other personÕs behavior.
Some people resist paraphrasing as a waste of time. One city
administrator explained during a practice session, ÒIÕm paid to give

facts and solutions, not to sit around doing psychotherapy with

everyone who comes into my office.Ó This same administrator,

however, was being confronted by angry citizens who would come

to him with their passionate concerns and leave dissatisfied for not

having been heard. Some of these citizens later confided to me,

ÒWhen you go to his office, he gives you a bunch of facts, but you
never know whether heÕs heard you first.

When that happens, you start to distrust

his facts.Ó Paraphrasing tends to save,
rather than waste, time. Studies in labor-management negotiations

demonstrate that the time required to reach conflict resolution is

cut in half when each negotiator agrees, before responding, to

accurately repeat what the previous speaker had said. 
I recall a man who was initially skeptical about the value of par-
aphrasing. He and his wife were attending an NVC workshop during

a time when their marriage was beset by serious problems. During
the workshop, his wife said to him, ÒYou never listen to me.Ó
ÒI do too,Ó he replied. 

ÒNo, you donÕt,Ó she countered.

I addressed the husband:
ÒIÕm afraid you just proved her point.
You didnÕt respond in a way that lets her know that you were

listening to her.Ó
He was puzzled by the point I was making, so I asked for
permission to play his roleÑwhich he gladly gave since he wasnÕt

having too much success with it. His wife and I then had the

following exchange:
Wife:
ÒYou never listen to me.Ó
MBR in role of husband:
ÒIt sounds like youÕre terribly frustrated
because you would like to feel more connection when we speak.Ó 
The wife was moved to tears when she finally received this
confirmation that she had been understood. I turned to the

husband and explained, ÒI believe this is what she is telling you she

needsÑa reflection of her feelings and needs as a confirmation that

sheÕd been heard.Ó The husband seemed dumfounded. ÒIs that all

she wanted?Ó he asked, incredulous that such a simple act could

have had such a strong impact on his wife. 
A short time later, he enjoyed the satisfaction firsthand when
his wife reflected back to him a statement that he had made with

great emotional intensity. Savoring her paraphrase, he looked at

me and declared, ÒItÕs valid.Ó It is a poignant experience to receive

concrete evidence that someone is empathically connected to us. 
Sustaining Empathy
I recommend allowing others the opportunity to fully express
themselves before turning our attention to solutions or requests for

relief. When we proceed too quickly to what people might be

requesting, we may not convey our genuine interest in their

feelings and needs; instead, they may get the impression that weÕre

in a hurry to either be free of them or to fix their problem.

Furthermore, an initial message is often like the tip of an iceberg;
___________________________________________R
ECEIVING
E
MPATHICALLY

¥
it may be followed by yet unexpressed, but relatedÑand often more
powerfulÑfeelings. By maintaining our attention on whatÕs going

on within others, we offer them a chance to fully explore and

express their interior selves. We would stem this flow if we were to

shift attention too quickly either to their request or to our own

desire to express ourselves. 
Suppose a mother comes to us,
saying, ÒMy child is impossible. No

matter what I tell him to do, he doesnÕt

listen.Ó We might reflect her feelings

and needs by saying, ÒIt sounds like
youÕre feeling desperate and would like to find some way of

connecting with your son.Ó Such a paraphrase often encourages a

person to look within. If we have accurately reflected her statement,

the mother might touch upon other feelings: ÒMaybe itÕs my fault.

IÕm always yelling at him.Ó As the listener, we would continue to

stay with the feelings and needs being expressed and say, for

example, ÒAre you feeling guilty because you would have liked to

have been more understanding of him than you have been at times?Ó

If the mother continues to sense understanding in our reflection, she

might move further into her feelings and declare, ÒIÕm just a failure

as a mother.Ó We continue to remain with the feelings and needs

being expressed: ÒSo youÕre feeling discouraged and want to relate

differently to him?Ó We persist in this manner until the person has

exhausted all her feelings surrounding this issue.
What evidence is there that weÕve
adequately empathized with the other

person? First, when an individual

realizes that everything going on

within has received full empathic

understanding, they will experience a

sense of relief. We can become aware of
this phenomenon by noticing a corresponding release of tension in

our own body. A second even more obvious sign is that the person

will stop talking. If we are uncertain as to whether we have stayed

When Pain Blocks Our Ability To Empathize
It is impossible for us to give something to another if we donÕt have

it ourselves. Likewise, if we find ourselves unable or unwilling to

empathize despite our efforts, it is usually a sign that we are too

starved for empathy to be able to offer it to others. Sometimes if we

openly acknowledge that our own distress is

preventing us from responding empathically,

the other person may come through with the

empathy we need. 
At other times, it may be necessary to provide ourselves with
some Òemergency first aidÓ empathy by listening to whatÕs going on

in ourselves with the same quality of presence and attention that we

offer to others. The former United Nations secretary-general, Dag

Hammarskjold, once said, ÒThe more faithfully you listen to the

voice within you, the better you will hear what is happening

outside.Ó If we become skilled in giving ourselves empathy, we often

experience in just a few seconds a natural release of energy that

then enables us to be present with the other person. If this fails to

happen, however, we have a couple of other choices.
We can screamÑnonviolently. I recall spending three days
mediating between two gangs that had been killing each other off.

One gang called themselves Black Egyptians; the other, the East St.

Louis Police Department. The score was two to oneÑa total of three

dead within a month. After three tense days trying to bring these

groups together to hear each other and resolve their differences, I

was driving home and thinking how I never wanted to be in the

middle of a conflict again for the rest of my life. 
The first thing I saw when I walked through the back door was
my children entangled in a fight. I had no energy to empathize

with them so I screamed nonviolently: ÒHey, IÕm in a lot of pain!

Right now I really do 
not 
want to deal with your fighting! I just
want some peace and quiet!Ó My older son, then nine, stopped

short, looked at me, and asked, ÒDo you want to talk about it?Ó If
we are able to speak our pain nakedly without blame, I find that

even people in distress are sometimes able to hear our need. Of

course I wouldnÕt want to scream, ÒWhatÕs the matter with you?

DonÕt you know how to behave any better? I just got home after a

rough day!Ó or insinuate in any way that their behavior is at fault.

I scream nonviolently by calling attention to my own desperate

needs and pain in this moment.
If, however, the other party is also experiencing such intensity
of feelings that they can neither hear us nor leave us alone, the

third recourse is to physically remove ourselves from the situation.

We give ourselves time out and the opportunity to acquire the

empathy we need to return in a different frame of mind. 
Summary
Empathy is a respectful understanding of what others are experi-

encing. Instead of offering empathy, we often have a strong urge

to give advice or reassurance and to explain our own position or

feeling. Empathy, however, calls upon us to empty our mind and

listen to others with our whole being.
In NVC, no matter what words others may use to express
themselves, we simply listen for their observations, feelings, needs,

and requests. Then we may wish to reflect back, paraphrasing what

we have understood. We stay with empathy, allowing others

the opportunity to fully express themselves before we turn our

attention to solutions or requests for relief. 
We need empathy to give empathy. When we sense ourselves
being defensive or unable to empathize, we need to (a) stop,

breathe, give ourselves empathy, (b) scream nonviolently, or (c) take

time out.

NVC in Action
A Wife Connects With Her Dying Husband
A patient has just been diagnosed with an advanced
state of lung cancer. The following scene at his home,

involving a visiting nurse, the patient, and his wife,

represents a last opportunity for him to connect emotionally

with his wife and discuss his dying before being admitted to

the hospital. The wife begins the conversation with the nurse

by complaining about the physical therapist who was part of

the home health care team assigned to her husbandÕs care. 
Wife:
SheÕs a bad therapist. 
Nurse:(listening empathically to what the wife is feeling
and wanting)
Are you feeling annoyed and
wanting to see a different quality of care?
Wife:
She doesnÕt do anything. She made him stop
walking when his pulse got high.
Nurse:(continuing to hear the wifeÕs feelings and wants)
Is it because you want your husband to get better

that youÕre scared if the physical therapist

doesnÕt push him, he wonÕt get stronger?
Wife:(starts to cry)
Yes, IÕm so scared!
Nurse:
Are you scared of losing him?
Wife:
Yes, weÕve been together so long.
Nurse:
(listening for other feelings behind the fear)
Are
you worrying about how you would feel if he dies?
Wife:
I just canÕt imagine how I am going to live
without him. HeÕs always been there for me.

Always.
Nurse:
So youÕre sad when you think of living without
him?
Wife:
There is no one else besides him. HeÕs all I have,
you know. My daughter wonÕt even talk to me.

Nurse:
It sounds like when you think of your daughter,

different relationship with her.
Wife:
I wish I did, but she is such a selfish person. I
donÕt know why I even bothered having kids. A

lot of good it does me now! 
Nurse:
Sounds to me like you might be somewhat angry
and disappointed because you want more support

from the family during your husbandÕs illness. 
Wife:
Yes, heÕs so sick; I donÕt know how I am going to
get through this alone. I havenÕt anyone . . . not

even to talk to, except with you here . . . now.

Even he wonÕt talk about it. . . . Look at him!

(Husband remains silent and impassive.)
He
doesnÕt say anything! 
Nurse:
Are you sad, wishing the two of you could
support each other and feel more connected?
Wife:
Yes. 
(She pauses, then makes a request)
Talk to
him the way you talk to me.
Nurse:(wishing to clearly understand the need that is
being addressed behind the wifeÕs request)
Are
you wanting him to be listened to in a way that

helps him express what heÕs feeling inside?
Wife:
Yes, yes, thatÕs exactly it! I want him to feel
comfortable talking and I want to know what he

is feeling. 
(Using the nurseÕs guess, the wife is
able to first become aware of what she wanted

and then find the words to articulate it. This is

a key moment: often it is difficult for people to

identify what they want in a situation, even

though they may know what they donÕt want. We

see how a clear requestÑÒTalk to him the way

you talk to meÓÑis a gift that empowers the

other person. The nurse is now able to act in a

Nurse:(turning to the husband)
How do you feel when
you hear what your wife has shared?
Husband:
I really love her.
Nurse:
Are you glad to have an opportunity to talk
about this with her?
Husband:
Yes, we need to talk about it.
Nurse:
Would you be willing to say how you are feeling
about the cancer?
Husband:
(after a brief silence)
Not very good. 
(The words
ÒgoodÓ and ÒbadÓ are often used to describe feel-

ings when people have yet to identify the specific

emotion they are experiencing. Expressing his

feelings more precisely would help him with the

emotional connection he is seeking with his wife.)
Nurse:
(encouraging him to move toward more precision)
Are you scared about dying?
Husband:
No, not scared. 
(Notice the nurseÕs incorrect guess
does not hamper the continued flow of dialogue.)
Nurse:
Do you feel angry about dying? 
(Because this
patient isnÕt able to verbalize his internal

experience easily, the nurse continues to support

him in the process.)
Husband:
No, not angry.
Nurse:(At this point, after two incorrect guesses, the
nurse decides to express her own feelings)
Well,
now IÕm puzzled about what you may be feeling,

and wonder if you can tell me.
Husband:
I reckon, IÕm thinking how sheÕll do without me.
Nurse:
Oh, are you worried she may not be able to
handle her life without you?
Husband:Yes, worried sheÕll miss me.

Patients sometimes need the reassurance that

loved ones can accept their death before they can

let themselves go.)
Do you want to hear how
your wife feels when you say that?
Husband:
Yes.
Here the wife joins the conversation; in the continued
presence of the nurse, the couple begins to express

themselves openly to each other. In this dialogue, the wife

begins with a complaint about the physical therapist.

However, after a series of exchanges during which she felt

empathically received, she is able to determine that what

she really seeks is a deeper connection with her husband

during this critical stage of their lives.

DIFFERENTIATING RECEIVING EMPATHICALLY
FROM RECEIVING NON-EMPATHICALLY.
If you would like an exercise to see whether we are communicating
about empathy, please circle the number in front of the statements

in which the person B is responding empathically to what is going

on within Person A.
1.Person A: How could I do something so stupid?
Person B: Nobody is perfect; youÕre too hard on yourself.
2.Person A: If you ask me, we ought to ship all these immigrants
back to where they came from.

Person B: Do you really think that would solve anything?
3.Person A: You arenÕt God!
Person B: Are you feeling frustrated because you would like me

to admit that there can be other ways of interpreting this matter?
4.Person A: I think that you take me for granted. I wonder how
you would manage without me.

Person B: ThatÕs not true! I donÕt take you for granted.
5. Person A: How could you say a thing like that to me?
Person B: Are you feeling hurt because I said that?
6. Person A: IÕm furious with my husband. HeÕs never around
when I need him.

Person B: You think he should be around more than he is?
7. Person A: IÕm disgusted with how heavy IÕm getting.
Person B: Perhaps jogging would help.
8. Person A: IÕve been a nervous wreck planning for my
daughterÕs wedding. Her fianc”Õs family is not helping. About

every day they change their minds about the kind of wedding

they would like.

Person B: So youÕre feeling nervous about how to make
arrangements and would appreciate it if your future in-laws

could be more aware of the complications their indecision

creates for you?
9.Person A: When my relatives come without letting me know
ahead of time I feel invaded. It reminds me of how my parents

used to disregard my needs and would plan things for me.

Person B: I know how you feel. I used to feel that way too.
10.Person A: IÕm disappointed with your performance. I would have
liked your department to double your production last month.

Person B: I understand that you are disappointed, but we have

had many absences due to illness.
Here are my responses to Exercise 5: 
1.I didnÕt circle this one because I see Person B giving reas-
surance rather than empathically receiving what Person A is

expressing.
2.I see Person B attempting to educate rather than empathically
receiving what Person A is expressing.
3.If you circled this we are in agreement. I see Person B empath-
ically receiving what Person A is expressing.
4.I see Person B disagreeing and defending rather than
empathically receiving what is going on in Person A.
5.I see Person B taking responsibility for Person AÕs feelings
rather than empathically receiving what is going on in Person

A. Person B might have said, ÒAre you feeling hurt because

you would have liked me to agree to do what you requested?Ó
6.If you circled this we are in partial agreement. I see Person B
receiving Person AÕs thoughts. However, I believe we are

connected more deeply when we receive the feelings and needs

being expressed rather than the thought. Therefore, I would

7.I see Person B giving advice rather than empathically receiving
what is going on in Person A.
8.If you circled this we are in agreement. I see Person B
empathically receiving what is going on in Person A.
9.I see Person B assuming that he/she has understood and
talking about his/her own feelings rather than empathically

receiving what is going on in Person A.
10.I see Person B starting by focusing on Person AÕs feelings but
then shifting to explaining.

CHAPTER EIGHT
Th e  Power of Em p a t h y
Empathy That Heals
C
arl Rogers described the impact of empathy on its recipients:
ÒWhen . . . someone really hears you without passing
judgment on you, without trying to take responsibility for you,

without trying to mold you, it feels damn good. . . . When I have

been listened to and when I have been heard, I am able to re-

perceive my world in a new way and go on. It is astonishing

how elements that seem insoluble

become soluble when someone listens.

How confusions that seem irremediable

turn into relatively clear flowing streams

when one is heard.Ó
One of my favorite stories about empathy comes from the
principal of an innovative school. She had returned after lunch one

day to find Milly, an elementary school student, sitting dejectedly

in her office waiting to see her. She sat down next to Milly, who

began, ÒMrs. Anderson, have you ever had a week when everything

you did hurt somebody else, and you never intended to hurt

anyone at all?Ó
ÒYes,Ó the principal replied, ÒI think I understand,Ó whereupon
Milly proceeded to describe her week. ÒBy now,Ó the principal

related, ÒI was quite late for a very important meetingÑstill had my

coat onÑand anxious not to keep a room full of

people waiting, and so I asked, ÔMilly, what can I

do for you?Õ Milly reached over, took both my

shoulders in her hands, looked me straight in the

a new way and move on.Ó
ÒDonÕt just do

something. . . .Ó
¥

¥
eyes, and said very firmly, ÔMrs. Anderson, I donÕt want you to 
do
anything; I just want you to listen.Õ 
This was one of the most significant moments of learning in
my lifeÑtaught to me by a childÑso I thought, ÔNever mind the

roomful of adults waiting for me!Õ Milly and I moved over to a

bench that afforded us more privacy and sat, my arm around her

shoulders, her head on my chest, and her arm around my waist,

while she talked until she was done. And you know, it didnÕt take

that long.Ó
One of the most satisfying aspects of my work is to hear how
individuals have used NVC to strengthen their ability to connect

empathically with others. My friend Laurence, who lives in

Switzerland, described how upset she had felt when her 6-year-old

son had stormed away angrily while she was still talking to him.

Isabelle, her 10-year-old daughter who had accompanied her to a

recent NVC workshop, remarked, ÒSo youÕre really angry, Mom.

YouÕd like for him to talk when heÕs angry and not run off.Ó

Laurence marveled at how, upon hearing IsabelleÕs words, she had

felt an immediate diminishing of tension, and was subsequently

able to be more understanding with her son when he returned.
A college instructor described how relationships between
students and faculty had been affected when several members of

the faculty learned to listen empathically and to express

themselves more vulnerably and honestly. ÒThe students opened up

more and more and told us about the various personal problems

that were interfering with their studies. The more they talked about

it, the more work they were able to complete. Even though this

kind of listening took a lot of our time, we were glad to spend it

in this way. Unfortunately, the dean got upset; he said we were not

counselors and should spend more time teaching and less time

talking with the students.Ó
When I asked how the faculty had dealt with this, the instructor
replied, ÒWe empathized with the deanÕs concern. We heard that he

felt worried and wanted to know that we werenÕt getting involved in

things we couldnÕt handle. We also heard that he needed reassurance
N
ONVIOLENT
C
OMMUNICATION

¥

¥
that the time spent on talking wasnÕt cutting into our teaching
responsibilities. He seemed relieved by the way we listened to him.

We continued to talk with the students because we could see that the

more we listened to them, the better they did in their studies.Ó 
When we work in a hierarchically structured institution, there is
a tendency to hear commands and judgments from those higher

up in the hierarchy. While we may easily

empathize with our peers and those in less

powerful positions, we may find ourselves

being defensive or apologetic, instead of

empathic, in the presence of those we

identify as our Òsuperiors.Ó This is why I

was particularly pleased that these faculty members had remembered

to empathize with their dean as well as with their students.
Empathy And The Ability To Be Vulnerable
Because we are called to reveal our deepest feelings and needs, we
may sometimes find it challenging to express ourselves in NVC.

Self-expression becomes easier, however, after we empathize with

others because we will then have touched their humanness and

realized the common qualities we share.

The more we connect with the feelings

and needs behind their words, the less

frightening it is to open up to other people.

The situations where we are the most

reluctant to express vulnerability are often those where we want to

maintain a Òtough imageÓ for fear of losing authority or control.
Once I showed my vulnerability to some members of a street
gang in Cleveland by acknowledging the hurt I was feeling and my

desire to be treated with more respect. ÒOh, look,Ó one of them

remarked, ÒheÕs feeling hurt; isnÕt that too bad!Ó at which point all

his friends chimed in laughing. Here again, I could interpret them

as taking advantage of my vulnerability (Option 2 - ÒBlame othersÓ)

or I could empathize with the feelings and needs behind their

behavior (Option 4).

ItÕs harder to empathize
with those who appear

to possess more power,

status, or resources.
The more we empathize

with the other party,

the safer we feel.
If, however, I have an image that IÕm being humiliated and
taken advantage of, I may be too wounded, angry, or scared to be

able to empathize. At such a moment, I would need to withdraw

physically in order to offer myself some empathy or to request it

from a reliable source. After I have discovered the needs that had

been so powerfully triggered in me and have received adequate

empathy for them, I shall then be ready to return and empathize

with the other party. In situations of pain, I recommend first

getting the empathy necessary to go beyond the thoughts

occupying our heads so as to recognize our deeper needs. 
As I listened closely to the gang memberÕs remark, ÒOh look,
heÕs feeling hurt, isnÕt that too bad?Ó and the laughter that

followed, I sensed that he and his friends were annoyed and not

wanting to be subjected to guilt trips and manipulation. They may

have been reacting to people in their pasts who used phrases like

Òthat hurts meÓ to imply disapproval. Since I didnÕt verify it with

them out loud, I have no way of knowing if my guess was in fact

accurate. Just focusing my attention there, however, kept me from

either taking it personally or getting angry. Instead of judging

them for ridiculing or treating me disrespectfully, I concentrated on

hearing the pain and needs behind such behavior. 
ÒHey,Ó one of them burst out, Òthis is a bunch of crap youÕre
offering us! Suppose there are members of another gang here and

they have guns and you donÕt. And you say just stand there and

talk 
to them? Crap!Ó
Then everybody was laughing again, and again I directed my
attention to their feelings and needs: ÒSo it sounds like youÕre

really fed up with learning something that has no relevance in

those situations?Ó
ÒYeah, and if you lived in this neighborhood, youÕd 
know
this
is a bunch of crap.Ó 
ÒSo you need to trust that someone teaching you something
has some knowledge of your neighborhood?Ó
ÒDamn right. Some of these dudes would blast you away before
you got two words out of your mouth!Ó

ÒAnd you need to trust that someone trying to teach you
something understands the dangers around here?Ó I continued to

listen in this manner, sometimes verbalizing what I heard and

sometimes not. This continued for forty-five minutes and then I sensed

a shift: they felt that I was truly understanding them. A counselor in

the program noticed the shift, and asked them out loud, ÒWhat do you

think of this man?Ó The gentleman who had been giving me the

roughest time replied, ÒHeÕs the best speaker weÕve ever had.Ó
Astonished, the counselor turned to me and whispered, ÒBut
you havenÕt said anything!Ó In fact, I had said a lot by demon-

strating that there was nothing they could

throw at me that couldnÕt be translated into

universal human feelings and needs. 
Using Empathy To Defuse Danger
The ability to offer empathy to people in stressful situations can

defuse potential violence. 
A teacher in the inner city of St. Louis related an incident
where she had conscientiously stayed after school to help a

student, even though teachers were warned to leave the building

for their own safety after classes were dismissed. A stranger

entered her classroom, where the following exchange took place:
Young man: ÒTake off your clothes.Ó

Teacher (noticing that he was shaking): ÒIÕm sensing this is very
scary for you.Ó
Young man: ÒDid you hear me? God damn it, take off your
clothes!Ó
Teacher: ÒIÕm sensing youÕre really pissed off right now and
you want me to do what youÕre telling me.Ó
Young man: ÒYouÕre damned right, and youÕre going to get hurt
if you donÕt.Ó
Teacher: ÒIÕd like you to tell me if thereÕs some other way of
meeting your needs that wouldnÕt hurt me.Ó
Young man: ÒI said take them off.Ó

time, I want you to know how scared and horrible I feel, and how

grateful IÕd be if youÕd leave without hurting me.Ó
Young man: ÒGive me your purse.Ó

The teacher handed the stranger her purse, relieved not to be
raped. She later described how, each time she empathized with the

young man, she could sense his becoming less adamant in his

intention to follow through with the rape. 
A metropolitan police officer attending a follow-up training in
NVC once greeted me with this account:
I
Õm sure glad you had us practicing empathy with

angry people that last time. Just a few days after
our session, I went to arrest someone in a public

housing project. When I brought him out, my car was

surrounded by about 60 people screaming things at

me like, ÔLet him go! He didnÕt do anything! You

police are a bunch of racist pigs!Õ Although I was

skeptical that empathy would help, I didnÕt have

many other options. So I reflected back the feelings

that were coming at me; I said things like, ÔSo you

donÕt trust my reasons for arresting this man? You

think it has to do with race?Õ After several minutes of

my continuing to reflect their feelings, the group

became less hostile. In the end they opened a path so

I could get to my car.
Finally, IÕd like to illustrate how a young woman used empathy
to bypass violence during her night shift at a drug detoxification

center in Toronto. The young woman recounted this story during a

second workshop she attended in NVC. At 11:00 p.m. one night, a

few weeks after her first NVC training, a man whoÕd obviously

been taking drugs walked in off the street and demanded a room.

The young woman started to explain to him that all the rooms had

been filled for the night. She was about to hand the man the

address of another detox center when he hurled her to the ground.
ÒThe next thing I knew, he was sitting across my chest holding a

knife to my throat and shouting, ÔYou bitch, donÕt lie to me! You

do too have a room!ÕÓ
She then proceeded to apply her training by listening for his
feelings and needs. 
ÒYou remembered to do that under those conditions?Ó I asked,
impressed.
ÒWhat choice did I have? Desperation sometimes makes good
communicators of us all! You know, Marshall,Ó she added, Òthat

joke you told in the workshop really helped me. In fact, I think it

saved my life.Ó
ÒWhat joke?Ó

ÒRemember when you said never to put your ÔbutÕ in the face
of an angry person? I was all ready to start arguing with him; I was

about to say, Ô
But
I donÕt have a room!Õ when I remembered your
joke. It had really stayed with me because only the week before, I

was arguing with my mother and sheÕd said to me, ÔI could kill you

when you answer ÒbutÓ to everything I say!Õ Imagine, if my own

mother was angry enough to kill me for using that word, what

would this man have done? If IÕd said, ÔBut I donÕt have a room!Õ

when he was screaming at me, I have no doubt he would have slit

my throat. 
So instead, I took a deep breath and
said, ÔIt sounds like youÕre really angry

and you want to be given a room.Õ He

yelled back, ÔI may be an addict, but by

God, I deserve respect. IÕm tired of nobody giving me respect. My

parents donÕt give me respect. IÕm gonna get respect!Õ I just focused

on his feelings and needs and said, ÔAre you fed up, not getting the

respect that you want?ÕÓ
ÒHow long did this go on?Ó I asked.

ÒOh, about another 35 minutes,Ó she replied.

ÒThat must have been terrifying.Ó
ÒNo, not after the first couple of interchanges, because then

something else weÕd learned here became apparent. When I
concentrated on listening for his feelings and needs, I stopped
seeing him as a monster. I could see, just

as youÕd said, how people who seem like

monsters are simply human beings whose

language and behavior sometimes keep us

from seeing their humanness. The more I

was able to focus my attention on his
feelings and needs, the more I saw him as a person full of despair

whose needs werenÕt being met. I became confident that if I held

my attention there, I wouldnÕt be hurt. After heÕd received the

empathy he needed, he got off me, put the knife away, and I helped

him find a room at another center.Ó 
Delighted that sheÕd learned to respond empathically in such an
extreme situation, I asked curiously, ÒWhat are you doing back

here? It sounds like youÕve mastered NVC and should be out

teaching others what youÕve learned.Ó
ÒNow I need you to help me with a hard one,Ó she said.

ÒIÕm almost afraid to ask. What could be harder than that?Ó

ÒNow I need you to help me with my mother. Despite all the
insight I got into that ÔbutÕ phenomenon, you know what
happened? At supper the next evening

when I told my mother what had

happened with the man, she said, ÔYouÕre

going to cause your father and me to have

a heart attack if you keep that job. You
simply have to find different work!Õ So guess what I said to her?

this out by asking, ÒSo youÕre feeling fearful and want to protect

yourself from being in a situation where you might be judged for

how you communicate?Ó
ÒYes,Ó she affirmed, ÒI can imagine sitting in the ice cream shop
with you and having you notice everything I say.Ó
I then discovered that the way IÕd been providing feedback in
the workshop had been frightening to her. My empathy for her

message had taken the sting out of her ÒnoÓ for me: I heard her

desire to avoid receiving similar feedback in public. Assuring her

that I wouldnÕt evaluate her communication in public, I then

conferred with her on ways to give feedback that would leave her

feeling safe. And yes, she joined the group for ice cream.
Empathy To Revive A Lifeless Conversation
We have all found ourselves in the midst of a lifeless

conversation. Perhaps weÕre at a social event, hearing words

without feeling any 
connection to the speaker. Or weÕre listening
to a ÒBabble-on-ianÓÑa term coined by my friend Kelly Bryson for

someone who elicits in their listeners the fear of interminable
conversation. Vitality drains out of conversations when we lose

connection with the feelings and needs generating the speakerÕs

words, and with the requests associated with those needs. This is

common when people talk without consciousness of what they are

feeling, needing, or requesting. Instead of being engaged in an

exchange of life energy with other human beings, we see

ourselves becoming wastebaskets for their words. 
How and when do we interrupt a dead conversation to bring it
back to life? IÕd suggest the best time to interrupt is when weÕve

heard one word more than we want to hear. The longer we wait,

the harder it is to be civil when we do step in. Our intention in

interrupting is not to claim the floor for ourselves, but to help the

speaker connect to the life energy behind the words being spoken. 
We do this by tuning in to possible feelings and needs. Thus,
if an aunt is repeating the story about how 20 years ago her
husband deserted her with two small

children, we might interrupt by saying,

ÒSo, Auntie, it sounds like you are still

feeling hurt, wishing youÕd been treated

more fairly.Ó People are not aware that it
is often empathy they are needing. Neither do they realize that

they are more likely to receive that empathy by expressing the

feelings and needs that are alive in them rather than by

recounting tales of past injustice and hardship. 
Another way to bring a conversation to life is to openly express
our desire to be more connected, and to request information that

would help us establish that connection. Once at a cocktail party I

was in the midst of an abundant flow of words that to me,

however, seemed lifeless. ÒExcuse me,Ó I broke in, addressing the

group of nine other people IÕd found myself with, ÒIÕm feeling

impatient because IÕd like to be more connected with you, but our

conversation isnÕt creating the kind of connection IÕm wanting. IÕd

like to know if the conversation weÕve been having is meeting your

needs, and if so, what needs of yours were being met through it.Ó

To bring a conversation

back to life: interrupt

with empathy. 
All nine people stared at me as if I had thrown a rat in the
punch bowl. Fortunately, I remembered to tune in to the feelings

and needs being expressed through their silence. ÒAre you annoyed

with my interrupting because you would have liked to continue the

conversation?Ó I asked.
After another silence, one of the men replied, ÒNo, IÕm not
annoyed. I was thinking about what you were asking. No, I wasnÕt

enjoying the conversation; in fact, I was

totally bored with it.Ó
At the time, I was surprised to hear his
response because he had been the one

doing most of the talking! Now I am no longer surprised: I have

since discovered that conversations that are lifeless for the listener

are equally so for the speaker. 
You may wonder how we can muster the courage to flatly
interrupt someone in the middle of a sentence. I once conducted

an informal survey, posing the following question: ÒIf you are

using more words than somebody wants to hear, do you want

that person to pretend to listen or to stop you?Ó Of the scores of

people I approached, all but one expressed a preference to be

stopped. Their answers gave me courage by convincing me that

it is more considerate to interrupt people

than to pretend to listen. All of us want our

words to enrich others, not to burden them. 
Empathy For Silence
One of the hardest messages for many of us to empathize with is

silence. This is especially true when weÕve expressed ourselves

vulnerably and need to know how others are reacting to our

words. At such times, itÕs easy to project our worst fears onto the

lack of response and forget to connect with the feelings and needs

being expressed through the silence. 
Once when I was working with the staff of a business organ-
ization, I was talking about something deeply emotional and began

to cry. When I looked up, I received a response from the organiza-
tionÕs director that was not easy for me to receive: silence. He
turned his face from me with what I

interpreted to be an expression of disgust.

Fortunately, I remembered to put my

attention on what might be going on within

him, and said, ÒIÕm sensing from your

response to my crying that youÕre feeling
disgusted, and youÕd prefer to have someone more in control of his

feelings consulting with your staff.Ó
If he had answered Òyes,Ó I would have been able to accept
that we had different values around expressing emotions, without

somehow thinking that I was wrong for having expressed my

emotions as I did. But instead of Òyes,Ó the director replied, ÒNo,

not at all. I was just thinking of how my wife wishes I could

cry.Ó He went on to reveal that his wife, who was divorcing him,

had been complaining that living with him was like living with

a rock. 
During my practice as a psychotherapist, I was once
contacted by the parents of a 20-year-old woman under

psychiatric care who, for several months, had been undergoing

medication, hospitalization, and shock treatments. She had

become mute three months before her parents contacted me.

When they brought her to my office, she had to be assisted

because, left to herself, she didnÕt move. 
In my office, she crouched in her chair, shaking, her eyes on
the floor. Trying to connect empathically with the feelings and

needs being expressed through her nonverbal message, I said, ÒIÕm

sensing that you are frightened and would like to be sure that itÕs

safe to talk. Is that accurate?Ó
She showed no reaction, so I expressed my own feeling by
saying, ÒIÕm very concerned about you, and IÕd like you to tell me

if thereÕs something I could say or do to make you feel safer.Ó Still

no response. For the next forty minutes, I continued to either

reflect her feelings and needs or express my own. There was no

visible response, nor even the slightest recognition that I was

trying to communicate with her. Finally I expressed that I was
tired, and that I wanted her to return the following day.
The next few days were like the first. I continued focusing my
attention on her feelings and needs, sometimes verbally reflecting

what I understood and sometimes doing so silently. From time to

time I would express what was going on in myself. She sat shaking

in her chair, saying nothing.
On the fourth day, when she still didnÕt respond, I reached
over and held her hand. Not knowing whether my words were

communicating my concern, I hoped the physical contact might do

so more effectively. At first contact, her muscles tensed and she

shrank further back into her chair. I was about to release her hand

when I sensed a slight yielding, so I kept my hold; after a few

moments I noticed a progressive relaxation on her part. I held her

hand for several minutes while I talked to her as I had the first few

days. Still she said nothing.
When she arrived the next day, she appeared even more tense
than before, but there was one difference: she extended a clenched

fist toward me while turning her face away from me. I was at first

confused by the gesture, but then sensed she had something in her

hand she wanted me to have. Taking her fist in my hand, I pried

open her fingers. In her palm was a crumpled note with the

following message: ÒPlease help me say whatÕs inside.Ó
I was elated to receive this sign of her desire to communicate.
After another hour of encouragement, she finally expressed a first

sentence, slowly and fearfully. When I reflected back what I had

heard her saying, she appeared relieved and then continued, slowly

and fearfully, to talk. A year later, she sent me a copy of the

following entries from her journal:
I
came out of the hospital, away from shock

treatments, and strong medicine. That was about
April. The three months before that are completely

blank in my mind, as well as the three and a half

years before April.

Summary
Our ability to offer empathy can allow us to stay vulnerable,

defuse potential violence, help us hear the word ÒnoÓ without

taking it as a rejection, revive a lifeless conversation, and even

hear the feelings and needs expressed through silence. Time and

again people transcend the paralyzing effects of psychological

pain when they have sufficient contact with someone who can

With O urselves
Let us become the change we seek in the world. 
ÑMahatma Gandhi 
W
e have seen how NVC contributes

to relationships with friends and
family, at work and in the political arena.

Its most crucial application, however,

may be in the way we treat ourselves.

When we are internally violent towards ourselves, it is difficult to

be genuinely compassionate towards others. 
Remembering The Specialness Of What We Are
In the play, ÒA Thousand ClownsÓ by Herb Gardner, the protagonist

refuses to release his 12-year-old nephew to child-welfare

authorities, declaring, ÒI want him to get to know exactly the

special thing he is or else he wonÕt notice it when it starts to go. I

want him to stay awake and . . . see . . . all the wild possibilities. I

want him to know itÕs worth all the trouble just to give the world

a little goosing when you get the chance. And I want him to know

the subtle, sneaky, important reason why he was born a human

being and not a chair.Ó 
I am gravely concerned that many of us have lost awareness of
Òthe special thingÓ we are; we have forgotten the Òsubtle, sneaky,
The most important use

oping self-compassion.  
¥

¥
important reasonÓ the uncle so passionately wanted his nephew to
know. When critical self-concepts prevent us from seeing the beauty

in ourselves, we lose connection with the divine energy that is our

source. Conditioned to view ourselves as objectsÑobjects full of

shortcomingsÑis it any wonder that many of us end up relating

violently to ourselves?
An important area where this violence can be replaced with
compassion is in our moment- to-moment evaluation of ourselves.

Since we want whatever we do to lead to the enrichment of life, it is

critical to know how to evaluate events and conditions in ways that
help us learn and make ongoing choices

that serve us. Unfortunately, the way weÕve

been trained to evaluate ourselves often

promotes more self-hatred than learning.
Evaluating Ourselves When 
WeÕve Been Less Than Perfect
In a routine workshop activity, I ask participants to recall a recent
occasion when they did something they wish they hadnÕt. We then

look at how they spoke to themselves immediately after having

made what is referred in common language as a ÒmistakeÓ or

Òerror.Ó Typical statements were: ÒThat was dumb!Ó ÒHow could

you do such an stupid thing?Ó ÒWhatÕs wrong with you?Ó ÒYouÕre

always messing up!Ó ÒThatÕs selfish!Ó
These speakers have been taught to judge themselves in ways
that imply that what they did was wrong or bad; their self-

admonishment implicitly assumes that they deserve to suffer for

what theyÕd done. It is tragic that so many of us get enmeshed in

self-hatred rather than benefit from mistakes which show us our

limitations and guide us towards growth.
Even when we sometimes do Òlearn a lessonÓ from mistakes for
which we judge ourselves harshly, I worry about the nature of the

energy behind that kind of change and learning. IÕd like change to

be stimulated by a clear desire to enrich life for ourselves or for

We use NVC to evaluate

ourselves in ways that

others rather than by destructive energies such as shame or guilt.
If the way we evaluate ourselves leads us to feel shame, and we
consequently change our behavior, we are allowing our growing

and learning to be guided by self-hatred. Shame is a form of self-

hatred, and actions taken in reaction to shame are not free and

joyful acts. Even if our intention is to behave with more kindness

and sensitivity, if people sense shame or guilt behind our actions,

they are less likely to appreciate what we do than if we are

motivated purely by the human desire to contribute to life.
In our language there is a word with enormous power to
create shame and guilt. This violent word, which we commonly

use to evaluate ourselves, is so deeply ingrained in our 
consciousness
that many of us would have trouble imagining how to live

without it. It is the word Òshould,Ó as in ÒI should have known

betterÓ or ÒI shouldnÕt have done that.Ó Most of the time when we

use this word with ourselves, we resist learning because ÒshouldÓ

implies that there is no choice. Human

beings, when hearing any kind of

demand, tend to resist because it

threatens our autonomyÑour strong need for choice. We have

this reaction to tyranny even when itÕs internal tyranny in the

form of a Òshould.Ó
A similar expression of internal demand occurs in the
following self-evaluation: ÒWhat IÕm doing is just terrible. I really

must do something about it!Ó Think for a moment of all the people

youÕve heard say, ÒI really should give up smoking.Ó or ÒI really

have to do something about exercising more.Ó They keep saying

what they ÒmustÓ do and they keep resisting doing it because

human beings were not meant to be slaves. We were not meant to

succumb to the dictates of ÒshouldÓ and Òhave to,Ó whether they

come from outside or inside of ourselves. And if we do yield and

submit to these demands, our actions arise from an energy that is

devoid of life-giving joy.

Avoid ÒshouldingÓ yourself!
Translating Self-Judgments
And Inner Demands 
When we communicate with ourselves on a regular basis through
inner judgment, blame and demand, itÕs not surprising that our self-

concept gives in to feeling Òmore like a chair than a human being.Ó

A basic premise of NVC is that whenever we imply that someone is

wrong or bad, what we are really saying is that he or she is not acting
in harmony with our needs. If the person we

are judging happens to be ourselves, what we

are saying is, ÒI myself am not behaving in

harmony with my own needs.Ó I am convinced

that if we learn to evaluate ourselves in terms

of whether and how well our needs are being
fulfilled, we are much more likely to learn from the evaluation. 
Our challenge then, when we are doing something that is not
enriching life, is to evaluate ourselves moment by moment in a

way that inspires change both: 
(1)in the direction of where we would like go, and 

(2)out of respect and compassion for ourselves, rather than
out of self-hatred, guilt or shame. 
NVC Mourning 
After a lifetime of schooling and socialization, it is probably too

late for most of us to train our minds to think purely in terms of

what we need and value from moment to moment. However, just

as we have learned to translate judgments when conversing with

others, we can train ourselves to recognize judgmental self-talk

and to immediately focus our attention on the underlying needs. 
For example, if we find ourselves reacting reproachfully to
something we did: ÒLook, you just messed up again!Ó, we can

quickly stop and ask ourselves, ÒWhat unmet need of mine is being

expressed through this moralistic judgment?Ó When we do connect

to the needÑand there may be several layers of needsÑwe will

notice a remarkable shift in our bodies. Instead of the shame, guilt,

Self-judgments, like

or depression we likely feel when criticizing ourselves for having
Òmessed up again,Ó we will experience any number of feelings.

Whether itÕs sadness, frustration, disappointment, fear, grief, or

some other feeling, we have been endowed by nature with these

feelings for a purpose: they mobilize us for action in pursuing and

fulfilling what we need or value. Their impact on our spirit and

bodies is substantially different from the disconnection that is

brought on by guilt, shame, and depression. 
Mourning in NVC is the process of fully connecting with the
unmet needs and feelings that are generated when we have been

less than perfect. It is an experience

of regret, but regret that helps us

learn from what we have done

without blaming or hating ourselves.

We see how our behavior ran counter

to our own needs and values, and we

open ourselves to feelings that arise out of that awareness. When

our consciousness is focused on what we need, we are naturally

stimulated towards the creative possibilities of how to get that need

met. In contrast, the moralistic judgments we use when blaming

ourselves tend to obscure such possibilities and to perpetuate a

state of self-punishment. 
Self-Forgiveness
We follow up on the process of mourning with self-forgiveness.

Turning our attention to the part of the self which chose to act in

the way that led to the present situation, we ask ourselves, ÒWhen

I behaved in the way which I now regret, what need of mine was I

trying to meet?Ó I believe that human beings are always acting in

the service of needs and values. This is true whether the action

does or does not meet the need, or whether itÕs one we end up

celebrating or regretting. 
When we listen empathically to ourselves, we will be able to
hear the underlying need. Self-forgiveness occurs the moment this

empathic connection is made. Then we are able to recognize how

needs stimulated by past

actions which we now regret.
our choice was an attempt to serve life,
even as the mourning process teaches us

how it fell short of fulfilling our needs. 
An important aspect of self-
compassion is to be able to empathically

hold both parts of ourselvesÑthe self

that regrets a past action and the self
that took the action in the first place. The process of mourning and

self-forgiveness free us in the direction of learning and growing. In

connecting moment by moment to our needs, we increase our

creative capacity to act in harmony with them.
The Lesson Of The Polka-Dotted Suit
I would like to illustrate the process of mourning and self-

forgiveness by recalling a personal event. The day before an

important workshop, I had bought a light gray summer suit to

wear. At the end of the well-attended workshop, I was swarmed

by participants asking for my address, signature, and other

information. With time closing in on another appointment, I

hastened to attend to the requests of the participants, signing and

scribbling on the many bits of paper thrust in front of me. As I

rushed out the door, I stuck my penÑuncappedÑin the pocket of

my new suit. Once outside, I discovered to my horror that instead

of the nice light gray suit, I now had a polka-dotted suit! 
For twenty minutes I was brutal with myself: ÒHow could you
be so careless? What a stupid thing to do!Ó I had just ruined a

brand new suit: if ever I needed compassion and understanding,

this was the time, yet here I was responding to myself in a way that

left me feeling worse than ever. 
FortunatelyÑafter only twenty minutesÑI noticed what I was
doing. I stopped, looked for the need of mine that was unmet by

having left the pen uncapped and asked myself, ÒWhat need lies

behind my judging myself as ÔcarelessÕ and ÔstupidÕÓ? 
Immediately I saw that it was to take better care of myself: to
have given more attention to my own needs while I was rushing to

address everyone elseÕs needs. As soon as I touched that part of
myself and connected to the deep longing to be more aware and

caring of my own needs, my feelings shifted. There was a release

of tension in my body as the anger, shame and guilt I was

harboring towards myself dissipated. I fully mourned the ruined

suit and uncapped pen as I opened to feelings of sadness now

arising along with the yearning to take better care of myself. 
Next I shifted my attention to the need I was meeting when I
slipped the uncapped pen in my pocket. I recognized how much I

valued care and consideration for other peopleÕs needs. Of course,

in taking such good care of other peopleÕs needs, I had not taken

the time to do the same for myself. But instead of blame, I felt a

wave of compassion for myself as I realized that even my rushing

and putting the pen away unthinkingly had come out of serving

my own need to respond to others in a caring way! 
In that compassionate place, I am
able to hold both needs: in one hand, to

respond in a caring 
way to othersÕ needs,
and in the other, to be aware of and take

better care of my own. Being conscious of

both needs, I can imagine ways of

behaving differently in 
similar situations
and arriving at solutions 
more resource-
fully than if I lose that 
consciousness in a
sea of self-judgment. 
ÒDonÕt do anything that isnÕt play!Ó
In addition to the process of mourning and self-forgiveness,

another aspect of self-compassion I emphasize is the energy behind

whatever action we take. When I advise, ÒDonÕt do anything that

isnÕt play!Ó some take me to be radical, even insane. I earnestly

believe, however, that an important form of self-compassion is to

make choices motivated purely by our desire to contribute to life

rather than out of fear, guilt, shame, duty, or obligation. When we

are conscious of the life-enriching purpose behind an action we

take, when the sole energy that motivates
us is simply to make life wonderful for

others and ourselves, then even hard

work has an element of play in it.

Correspondingly, an otherwise joyful

activity performed out of obligation, duty,

fear, guilt or shame will lose its joy and
eventually engender resistance. 
In Chapter 2, we considered replacing language that implies
lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice. Many

years ago I engaged in an activity which significantly enlarged the

pool of joy and happiness available to my life, while diminishing

depression, guilt, and shame. I offer it here as a possible way to

deepen our compassion for ourselves, to help us live our lives out

of joyous play by staying grounded in a clear awareness of the life-

enriching need behind everything we do. 
Translating ÒHave toÓ To ÒChoose toÓ
Step One 

What do you do in your life that you donÕt experience as playful?

List on a piece of paper all those things that you tell yourself you

have to do, any activity you dread but do anyway because you

perceive yourself to have no choice. 
When I first reviewed my own list, just seeing how long it was
gave me insight as to why so much of my time was spent not

enjoying life. I noticed how many things in an ordinary day I was

doing by tricking myself into believing that I had to do them. 
The first item on my list was Òwrite clinical reports.Ó I hated
doing these reports, yet I was spending at least an hour of agony

over them every day. My second item was Òdrive the childrenÕs

carpool to school.Ó

you have to. Insert the words ÒI choose to . . . Ó in front of each
item you listed. 
I recall my own resistance to this step. ÒWriting clinical reports,Ó
I insisted to myself, Òis not something I choose to do! I have to do

it. IÕm a clinical psychologist. I have to write these reports.Ó 
Step three 
After having acknowledged that you chose to do a particular

activity, get in touch with the intention behind the choice by

completing the statement, ÒI choose to ____ because I want _____.Ó 
At first I fumbled to identify what I wanted from writing clinical
reports. Several months earlier, I had already determined that the

reports did not serve my clients enough to justify the time they were

taking, so why was I continuing to invest so much energy in their

preparation? Finally I realized that I was choosing to write the

reports solely because I wanted the income they provided. As soon

as I recognized this, I never wrote another clinical report. I canÕt tell

you how joyful I feel just thinking of how many clinical reports I

havenÕt written since that moment 35 years ago! When I realized

that money was my primary motivation, I immediately saw that I

could find other ways to take care of myself financially, and that in

fact, IÕd rather scavenge in garbage cans for food than to write

another clinical report. 
The next item on my list of unjoyful
tasks was driving the children to school.

When I examined the reason behind that

chore, however, I felt appreciation for the

benefits my children received from

attending their current school. They could easily walk to the

neighborhood school, but their own school was far more in harmony

with my educational values. I continued to drive, but with a different

energy; instead of ÒOh, darn, I have to drive carpool today,Ó I was

conscious of my purpose, which was for my children to have a

quality of education that was very dear to me. Of course I sometimes

needed to remind myself two or three times during the drive to

refocus my mind on what purpose my action was serving.

Cultivating Awareness Of The Energy 
Behind Our Actions 
As you explore the statement, ÒI choose to ____ because I want
____Ó, you may discover Ñ as I did with the childrenÕs carpool Ñ

the important values behind the choices youÕve made. I am

convinced that after we gain clarity regarding the need being

served by our actions, we can experience them as play even when

they involve hard work, challenge or frustration. 
For some items on your list, however, you might uncover one
or several of the following motivations:
1) FOR MONEY

Money is a major form of extrinsic reward in our society.
Choices prompted by a desire for reward are costly: they deprive us

of the joy in life that comes with actions grounded in the clear

intention to contribute to a human need. Money is not a ÒneedÓ as

we define it in NVC; it is one of countless strategies that may be

selected to address a need. 
2) FOR APPROVAL

Like money, approval from others is a form of extrinsic reward.
Our culture has educated us to hunger for reward. We attended

schools that used extrinsic means to motivate us to study; we grew

up in homes where we were rewarded for being good little boys

and girls, and punished when our caretakers judged us to be

otherwise. Thus, as adults we easily trick ourselves into believing

that life consists of doing things for reward; we are addicted to

getting a smile, a pat on the back, and peopleÕs verbal judgments

that we are a Ògood person,Ó Ògood parent,Ó Ògood citizen,Ó Ògood

worker,Ó Ògood friend,Ó etc. We do things to get people to like us,

and avoid things that may lead them to dislike or punish us. 
I find it tragic that we work so hard to buy love and assume
that we must deny ourselves and do for others in order to be liked.

In fact, when we do things solely in the spirit of enhancing life, we

will find others appreciating us. Their appreciation, however, is

only a feedback mechanism confirming that our efforts had the

intended effect. The recognition that we have chosen to use our
N

¥
power to serve life and have done so successfully brings us the
genuine joy of celebrating ourselves in a way that approval from

others can never offer.
3) TO ESCAPE PUNISHMENT
Some of us pay income tax primarily to avoid punishment. As a
consequence we are likely to approach that yearly ritual with a

degree of resentment. I recall, however, in my childhood how

differently my father and grandfather felt about paying taxes. They

had immigrated from Russia to the United States, and were desirous

of supporting a government they believed were protecting people in

a way that the czar had not. Imagining the many people whose

welfare was being served by their tax money, they felt earnest

pleasure as they sent their checks to the U.S. government. 
4) TO AVOID SHAME

There may be some tasks we choose to do just to avoid shame.
We know that if we donÕt do them, weÕll end up suffering severe

self-judgment, hearing our own voice telling us how there is

something wrong or stupid about us. If we do something

stimulated solely by the urge to avoid shame, we will generally end

up detesting it.
5) TO AVOID GUILT

In other instances, we may think,
ÒIf I donÕt do this, people will be

disappointed in me. Ó We are afraid

weÕll end up feeling guilty for failing

to fulfill other peopleÕs expectations

of us. There is a world of difference

between doing something for others in order to avoid guilt and

doing it out of a clear awareness of our own need to contribute to

the happiness of other human beings. The first is a world filled

with misery; the second is a world filled with play. 
6) OUT OF DUTY

When we use language which denies choice, e.g. words such as
Òshould,Ó Òhave to,Ó Òought,Ó Òmust,Ó ÒcanÕt,Ó Òsupposed to,Ó etc., our

behaviors arise out of a vague sense of guilt, duty, or obligation. I

consider this to be the most socially dangerous and personally
unfortunate of all the ways we act when weÕre cut off from our needs.
In Chapter 2 we saw how the concept of ÒAmtsspracheÓ allowed
Adolf Eichmann and his colleagues to send tens of thousands of

people to their deaths without feeling emotionally affected or

personally responsible. When we speak a language that denies

choice, we forfeit the life in ourselves for a robot-like mentality

that disconnects us from our own core.
After examining the list of items you
have generated, you may decide to stop

doing certain things in the same spirit

that I chose to forego clinical reports. As

radical as it may seem, it is possible to do

things only out of play. I believe that to
the degree that we engage moment by moment in the playfulness

of enriching lifeÑmotivated solely by the desire for its enrichmentÑ

to that degree are we being compassionate with ourselves.
Summary
The most crucial application of NVC may be in the way we treat

ourselves. When we make mistakes, we can use the process of NVC

mourning and self-forgiveness to show us where we can grow

instead of getting caught up in moralistic self-judgments. By

assessing our behaviors in terms of our own unmet needs, the

impetus for change comes not out of shame, guilt, anger or

depression, but out of the genuine desire to contribute to our own

and othersÕ well-being.
We also cultivate self-compassion by consciously choosing in
daily life to act only in service to our own needs and values rather

than out of duty, for extrinsic rewards, or to avoid guilt, shame, and

punishment. If we review the joyless acts to which we currently

subject ourselves and make the translation from Òhave toÓ to

Òchoose to,Ó we will discover more play and integrity in our lives.

CHAPTER TEN
Expressing Anger Fully
T
he subject of anger gives us a unique opportunity to dive more
deeply into NVC. Because it brings many aspects of this process
into sharp focus, the expression of anger clearly demonstrates the

difference between NVC and other forms of communication. 
I would like to suggest that killing people is too superficial.
Killing, hitting, blaming, hurting othersÑwhether physically or

mentallyÑare all superficial expressions of what is going on within

us when we are angry. If we are truly angry, we would want a

much more powerful way to fully express ourselves.
This understanding comes as a
relief to many groups I work with

that experience oppression and

discrimination and want to increase their power to effect change.

Such groups are uneasy when they hear the terms ÒnonviolentÓ or

ÒcompassionateÓ communication because they have so often been

urged to stifle their anger, calm down, and accept the status quo.

They worry about approaches that view their anger as an undesirable

quality needing to be purged. The process we are describing,

however, does not encourage us to ignore, squash, or swallow anger,

but rather to express the core of our anger fully and wholeheartedly. 
Distinguishing Stimulus From Cause
The first step to fully expressing anger in NVC is to divorce the

other person from any responsibility for our anger. We rid ourselves

of thoughts such as, ÒHe, she, or they made me angry when they did
¥
141
¥
Killing people is too superficial.
that.Ó Such thinking leads us to express our
anger superficially by blaming or punishing the

other person. Earlier we saw that the behavior

of others may be a stimulus for our feelings, but
not the cause. We are never angry because of what someone else

did. We can identify the other personÕs behavior as the stimulus,

but it is important to establish a clear separation between stimulus

and cause. 
IÕd like to illustrate this distinction with an example from my
work at a Swedish prison. My job was to show prisoners who had

behaved in violent ways how to fully express their anger rather

than to kill, beat, or rape other people. During an exercise calling

on them to identify the stimulus of their anger, one prisoner wrote:

ÒThree weeks ago I made a request to the prison officials and they

still havenÕt responded to it.Ó His statement was a clear observation

of a stimulus, describing what other people had done. 
I then asked him to state the cause of his anger: ÒWhen this
happened, you felt angry because 
what
?Ó
ÒI just told you,Ó he exclaimed. ÒI felt angry because they didnÕt
respond to my request!Ó By equating stimulus and cause, he had

tricked himself into thinking that it was the behavior of the prison

officials that was making him angry. This is an easy habit to

acquire in a culture that uses guilt as a means of controlling

people. In such cultures, it becomes important to trick people into

thinking that we can 
make
others feel a certain way.
Where guilt is a tactic of manipulation and coercion, it is useful
to confuse stimulus and cause. As mentioned earlier, children who
hear, ÒIt hurts Mommy and Daddy when

you get poor gradesÓ are led to believe

that their behavior is the cause of their

parentsÕ pain. The same dynamic is
observed among intimate partners: ÒIt really disappoints me when

youÕre not here for my birthday.Ó The English language facilitates

the use of this guilt-inducing tactic. 
We say: ÒYou make me angry.Ó ÒYou hurt me by doing that.Ó ÒI

feel sad because you did that.Ó We use our language in many
different ways to trick ourselves into believing that our feelings

result from what others do. The first step in the process of fully

expressing our anger is to realize that what other people do is

never the cause of how we feel.
So what is the cause of anger? In
Chapter 5, we discussed the four options

we have when confronted with a

message or behavior that we donÕt like.

Anger is generated when we choose the second option: whenever

we are angry, we are finding faultÑwe choose to play God by

judging or blaming the other person for being wrong or deserving

of punishment. I would like to suggest that this is the cause of

anger. Even if we are not initially conscious of it, the cause of

anger is located in our own thinking.
The third option described in Chapter 5 is to shine the light of
consciousness on our own feelings and needs. Rather than going

up to our head to make a mental analysis of wrongness regarding

somebody, we choose to connect to the life that is within us. This

life energy is most palpable and accessible when we focus on what

we need in each moment.
For example, if someone arrives late for an appointment and
we need reassurance that she cares about us, we may feel hurt. If,

instead, our need is to spend time purposefully and constructively,

we may feel frustrated. If, on the other hand, our need is for thirty

minutes of quiet solitude, we may be grateful for her tardiness and

feel pleased. Thus, it is not the behavior of the other person, but

our own need that causes our feeling. When we are connected to

our need, whether it is for reassurance, purposefulness, or solitude,

we are in touch with our life energy. We may have strong feelings,

but we are never angry. Anger is a result of life-alienating thinking

that is disconnected from needs. It indicates that we have moved

up to our head to analyze and judge somebody, rather than focus

on which of our needs are not getting met. 
In addition to the third option of focusing on our own needs and

of blame and judgment.
feelings, the choice is ours at any moment to shine the light of
consciousness on the other personÕs feelings and needs. When we

choose this fourth option, we also never feel anger. We are not

repressing the anger; we see how anger is simply absent in each

moment that we are fully present with the other personÕs feelings

and needs.
All Anger Has A Life-Serving Core
ÒBut,Ó I am asked, ÒarenÕt there circumstances in which anger is

justified? IsnÕt Ôrighteous indignationÕ called for in the face of careless,

thoughtless pollution of the environment, for example?Ó My answer

is that I strongly believe that to whatever degree I support the
consciousness that there 
is
such a thing
as a Òcareless action,Ó or a Òconscientious

action,Ó a Ògreedy person,Ó or a Òmoral

person,Ó I am contributing to violence on
this planet. Rather than agreeing or disagreeing about what people

are
for murdering, raping, or polluting the environment, I believe we
serve life better by focusing attention on what we are needing. 
I see all anger as a result of life-alienating, violence-provocative
thinking. At the core of all anger is a need that is not being fulfilled.

Thus anger can be valuable if we use it as an alarm clock to wake

us upÑto realize we have a need that isnÕt being met and that we are
thinking in a way that makes it unlikely to be met.

To fully express anger requires full consciousness of

our need. In addition, energy is required to get the

need met. Anger, however, co-opts our energy by
directing it toward punishing people rather than meeting our needs.

Instead of engaging in Òrighteous indignation,Ó I recommend

connecting empathically with our own needs or those of others. This

may take extensive practice, whereby over and over again, we

consciously replace the phrase ÒI am angry because they . . . Ó with

ÒI am angry 
because I am needing
. . . Ó

successive days I was hit on the nose in
remarkably similar ways. The first time I

received a sharp blow across the nose

from an elbow while interceding in a

fight between two students. I was so

enraged it was all I could do to keep myself from hitting back. On

the streets of Detroit where I grew up, it took far less than an elbow

in the nose to provoke me to rage. The second day: similar situation,

same nose (and thus more physical pain), but not a bit of anger! 
Reflecting deeply that evening on this experience, I recognized
how I had labeled the first child in my mind as a Òspoiled brat.Ó

That image was in my head before his elbow ever caught my nose,

and when it did, it was no longer simply an elbow hitting my nose.

It was: ÒThat obnoxious brat has no right to do this!Ó I had another

judgment about the second child; I saw him as a Òpathetic

creature.Ó Since I had a tendency to worry about this child, even

though my nose was hurting and bleeding much more severely the

second day, I felt no rage at all. I could not have received a more

powerful lesson to help me see that itÕs not what the other person

does, but the images and interpretations in my own head that

produce my anger. 
Stimulus Versus Cause: Practical Implications
I emphasize the distinction between cause and stimulus on

practical and tactical as well as on philosophical grounds. IÕd like

to illustrate this point by returning to my dialogue with John, the

Swedish prisoner:
John:
ÒThree weeks ago I made a request to the prison officials
and they still havenÕt responded to my request.Ó

MBR:

When we become
aware of our needs,

Three hours later John approached me
and said, ÒMarshall, I wish you had taught

me two years ago what you taught me this

morning. I wouldnÕt have had to kill my

best friend.Ó 
All violence is the result of people
tricking themselves, as did this young

prisoner, into believing that their pain derives from other people

and that consequently those people deserve to be punished. 
One time I saw my younger son take a fifty-cent piece from his
sisterÕs room. I said, ÒBrett, did you ask your sister whether you

could have that?Ó ÒI didnÕt take it from her,Ó he answered. Now I

faced my four options. I could have called him a liar, which would,

however, have worked against my getting my needs met since any

judgment of another person diminishes the likelihood of our needs

being met. Where I focused my attention at this moment was

critical. If I were to judge him as lying, it would point me in one

direction. If I were to interpret that he didnÕt respect me enough to

tell me the truth, I would be pointed in

another direction. If, however, I were either

to empathize with him at that moment, or

express nakedly what I was feeling and

needing, I would greatly increase the

possibility of getting my needs met.
The way I expressed my choiceÑwhich
in this situation turned out helpfulÑwas not

so much through what I said, but through

what I did. Instead of judging him as lying,

I tried to hear his feeling: he was scared,

and his need was to protect himself against

being punished. By empathizing with him, I had the chance of

making an emotional connection out of which we could both get

our needs met. However, if I had approached him with the view

that he was lyingÑeven if I hadnÕt expressed it out loudÑhe would

have been less likely to feel safe expressing truthfully what had

happened. I would have then become part of
the process: by the very act of judging

another person as a liar, I would contribute to

a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why would people

want to tell the truth, knowing they will be
judged and punished for doing so? 
I would like to suggest that when our heads are filled with
judgments and analyses that others are bad, greedy, irresponsible,

lying, cheating, polluting the environment, valuing profit more

than life, or behaving in other ways they shouldnÕt, very few of

them will be interested in our needs. If we want to protect the

environment and we go to a corporate executive with the attitude,

ÒYou know, you are really a killer of the planet, you have no right

to abuse the land in this way,Ó we have severely impaired our

chances of getting our needs met. It is a rare human being who can

maintain focus on our needs when we are expressing them through

images of their wrongness. Of course, we may be successful in

using such judgments to intimidate people into meeting our needs.

If they feel so frightened, guilty, or ashamed that they change their

behavior, we may come to believe that it is possible to ÒwinÓ by

telling people whatÕs wrong with them. 
With a broader perspective, however, we realize that each time
our needs are met in this way, we not only lose, but we have

contributed very tangibly to violence on the planet. We may have

solved an immediate problem, but we will have created another

one. The more people hear blame and judgment, the more

defensive and aggressive they become and the less they will care

about our needs in the future. So even if our present need is met,

in the sense that people do what we want, we will pay for it later. 
Four Steps To Expressing Anger
LetÕs look at what the process of fully expressing our anger

actually requires in concrete form. The first step is to stop and do

nothing except to breathe. We refrain from making any move to

blame or punish the other person. We simply stay quiet. Then we

fulfilling prophecies.
identify the thoughts that are making
us angry. For example, we overhear a

statement that leads us to believe

that weÕve been excluded from a 

conversation because of race. We

sense anger, stop and recognize the

thoughts stirring in our head: ÒItÕs

unfair to act like that. SheÕs being

racist.Ó We know that all judgments

like these are tragic expressions of unmet needs, so we take the

next step and connect to the needs behind those thoughts. If I

judge someone to be racist, the need may be for inclusion, equality,

respect, or connection. 
To fully express ourselves, we now open our mouths and speak
the angerÑbut the anger has been transformed into needs and

need-connected feelings. To articulate these feelings, however, may

require a lot of courage. For me itÕs easy to get angry and tell

people, ÒThat was a racist thing to do!Ó In fact, I may even enjoy

saying such things, but to get down to the deeper feelings and

needs behind such a statement may be very frightening. To fully

express our anger, we may say to the person, ÒWhen you entered

the room and started talking to the others and didnÕt say anything

to me and then made the comment about white people, I felt really

sick to my stomach, and got so scared; it triggered off all kinds of

needs on my part to be treated equally. IÕd like you to tell me how

you feel when I tell you this.Ó
Offering Empathy First 
In most cases, however, another step needs to take place before we

can expect the other party to connect with what is going on in us.

Because it will often be difficult for others to receive our feelings and

needs in such situations, we would need first to empathize with them

if we want them to hear us. The more we empathize with what leads

them to behave in the ways that are not meeting our needs, the more

likely it is that they will be able to reciprocate afterwards.

Steps to expressing anger:

1. Stop. Breathe.

2.Identify our judgmental
thoughts.
3.Connect with our needs.

4.Express our feelings and
unmet needs.
Over the last thirty years IÕve had a wealth of
experience speaking NVC with people who

harbor strong beliefs about specific races and

ethnic groups. Early one morning I was picked

up by a cab at an airport to take me into town.
A message from the dispatcher came over the loud speaker for the

cabbie: ÒPick up Mr. Fishman at the synagogue on Main Street.Ó

The man next to me in the cab muttered, ÒThese kikes get up early

in the morning so they can screw everybody out of their money.Ó 
For twenty seconds, there was smoke coming out of my ears.
In earlier years, my first reaction would have been to want to

physically hurt such a person. Now I took a few deep breaths

and 
then gave myself some empathy for the hurt, fear, and rage
that were stirring inside me. I attended to my feelings. I stayed

conscious that my anger wasnÕt coming from my fellow passenger

nor the statement he had just made. His comment had triggered off

a volcano inside of me, but I knew that my anger and profound

fear came from a far deeper source than those words he had just

uttered. I sat back and simply allowed the violent thoughts to play

themselves out. I even enjoyed the image of actually grabbing his

head and smashing it. 
Giving myself this empathy enabled me to then focus my
attention on the humanness behind his message, after which the

first words out of my mouth were, ÒAre you feeling . . . ?Ó I tried to

empathize with him, to hear his pain. Why? Because I wanted to see

the beauty in him and for him to fully apprehend what I had

experienced when he made his remark. I knew I wouldnÕt receive

that kind of 
understanding if there were a storm 
brewing inside of
him. My intention was to connect with him and to show a respectful
empathy for the life energy in him that was

behind the comment. My experience told

me that If I were able to empathize, then he

would be able to hear me in return. It

would not be easy, but he would be able to. 
ÒAre you feeling frustrated?Ó I asked.

theyÕll do anything for money.Ó 
ÒYou feel distrust and the need to protect yourself when youÕre
involved in financial affairs with them?Ó
ÒThatÕs right!Ó he exclaimed, continuing to release more
judgments, as I listened for the feeling and need behind each one.

When we settle our attention on other peopleÕs feelings and needs,

we experience our common humanity. When I hear that heÕs scared

and wants to protect himself, I recognize how I also have a need

to protect myself and I too know what itÕs like to be scared. When

my consciousness is focused on another human beingÕs feelings

and needs, I see the universality of our

experience. I had a major conflict with

what went on in his head, but IÕve learned

that I enjoy human beings more if I donÕt

hear what they think. Especially with

folks who have his kind of thoughts, IÕve

learned to savor life much more by only hearing whatÕs going on in

their hearts and not getting caught up with the stuff in their heads.
This man kept on pouring out his sadness and frustration. Before
I knew it, heÕd finished with Jews and moved on to Blacks. He was

charged with pain around a number of subjects. After nearly ten

minutes of my just listening, he stopped: he had felt understood.
Then I let him know what was going on in me: 

MBR:

Man:
ÒYouÕre saying I have no right to talk the way I did.Ó
MBR:
ÒNo, I would like you to hear me differently. I really donÕt
want to blame you. I have no desire to blame you.Ó
I intended to slow down the conversation, because in my
experience, to whatever degree people hear blame, they have failed

to hear our pain. If this man said, ÒThose were terrible things for
me to say; those were racist remarks I

made,Ó he would not have heard my pain.

As soon as people think that they have

done something wrong, they will not be

fully apprehending our pain. 
I didnÕt want him to hear blame, because I wanted him to know
what had gone on in my heart when he uttered his remark.

Blaming is easy. People are used to hearing blame; sometimes they

agree with it and hate themselvesÑwhich doesnÕt stop them from

behaving the same wayÑand sometimes they hate us for calling

them racists or whateverÑwhich also doesnÕt stop their behavior. If

we sense blame entering their mind, as I did in the cab, we may

need to slow down, go back and hear their pain for a while more.

use as a Òcheat sheetÓ at work. When his boss would confront him,

Sam would stop, refer to the card in his hand, and take time to

remember how to respond. When I asked whether his colleagues

were finding him a little strange, constantly staring into his hand

and taking so much time to form his sentences, Sam replied, ÒIt

doesnÕt actually take that much more time, but even if it did, itÕs

still worth it to me. ItÕs important for me to know that I am

responding to people the way I really want to.Ó At home he was

more overt, explaining to his wife and children why he was taking

the time and trouble to consult the card. Whenever there was an

argument in the family, he would pull out the card and take his

time. After about a month, he felt comfortable enough to put it

away. Then one evening, he and Scottie, age 4, were having a

conflict over television and it wasnÕt going well. ÒDaddy,Ó Scottie

said urgently, Òget the card!Ó 
For those of you wishing to apply NVC,
especially in challenging situations of anger,

I would suggest the following exercise. As

we have seen, our anger comes from

judgments, labels, and thoughts of blame, of

what people ÒshouldÓ do and what they Òdeserve.Ó List the

judgments that float most frequently in your head by using the

cue, ÒI donÕt like people who are. . . . Ó Collect all such negative

judgments in your head and then ask yourself, ÒWhen I make that

judgment of a person, what am I needing and not getting?Ó In this

way, you train yourself to frame your thinking in terms of unmet

needs rather than in terms of judgments of other people. 
Practice is essential, because most of us were raised, if not on
the streets of Detroit, then somewhere only slightly less violent.

Judging and blaming have become second nature

to us. To practice NVC, we need to proceed slowly,

think carefully before we speak, and often just

take a deep breath and not speak at all. Learning the process and
applying it both take time.
Summary
Blaming and punishing others are superficial expressions of anger.
If we wish to fully express anger, the first step is to divorce the

other person from any responsibility for our anger. Instead we

shine the light of consciousness on our own feelings and needs. By

expressing our needs, we are far more likely to get them met than

by our judging, blaming, or punishing others. 
The four steps to expressing anger are (1) stop and breathe, (2)
identify our judgmental thoughts, (3) connect with our needs, and

(4) express our feelings and unmet needs. Sometimes in between

steps 3 and 4 we may choose to empathize with the other person

so that he or she will be better able to hear us when we express

ourselves in Step 4. 
We need to take our time in both learning and applying the
process of NVC.

In this situation, 15-year-old Bill took a car without
permission from Jorge, a family friend. He went on a joy

ride with two friends and returned the car undamaged to

the garage, where its absence had not been detected. Since

then, however, JorgeÕs 14-year-old daughter, Eva, who had

gone along for the ride, told her father what had happened.

Jorge then informed BillÕs father, who is now approaching

CHAPTER ELEVEN
Th e  Pr otec tiv e 
Use Of Force
When The Use Of Force Is Unavoidable
W
hen two disputing parties have each had an opportunity to
fully express what they are observing, feeling, needing, and
requestingÑand each has empathized with the otherÑa resolution

can usually be reached that meets the needs of both sides. At the

very least, the two can agree, in goodwill, to disagree.
In some situations, however, the opportunity for such dialogue
may not exist, and the use of force may be necessary to protect life

or individual rights. For instance, the other party may be unwilling

to communicate, or imminent danger may not allow time for

communication. In these situations, we may need to resort to force.

If we do, NVC requires us to differentiate between the protective

and the punitive uses of force. 
The Thinking Behind The Use Of Force
The intention behind the protective use of force is to prevent injury

or injustice. The intention behind the punitive use of force is to

cause individuals to suffer for their perceived misdeeds. When we

grab a child who is running into the street to prevent the child from

being injured, we are applying protective force. The punitive use of

force, on the other hand, might involve physical or psychological

attack, such as spanking the child or reproofs like, ÒHow could you

be so stupid! You should be ashamed of yourself!Ó
When we exercise the protective use of force, we are focusing
¥
161
¥
on the life or rights we want to protect
without passing judgment on either the

person or the behavior. We are not

blaming or condemning the child rushing

into the street; our thinking is solely

directed toward protecting the child from

danger. (For application of this kind of
force in social and political conflicts, see Robert IrwinÕs book,

Nonviolent Social Defense.) The assumption behind the protective

use of force is that people behave in ways injurious to themselves

and others due to some form of ignorance. The corrective process

is therefore one of education, not punishment. Ignorance includes

(a) a lack of awareness of the consequences of our actions, (b) an

inability to see how our needs may be met without injury to others,

(c) the belief that we have the ÒrightÓ to punish or hurt others

because they ÒdeserveÓ it, and (d) delusional thinking that involves,

for example, hearing a ÒvoiceÓ that instructs us to kill someone. 
Punitive action, on the other hand, is based on the assumption
that people commit offenses because they are bad or evil, and to

correct the situation, they need to be made to repent. Their

ÒcorrectionÓ is undertaken through punitive action designed to

make them (1) suffer enough to see the error of their ways, (2)

repent, and (3) change. In practice, however, punitive action, rather

than evoking repentance and learning, is just as likely to generate

resentment and hostility and to reinforce resistance to the very

behavior we are seeking.
Types Of Punitive Force
Physical punishment, such as spanking, is one punitive use of

force. I have found the subject of corporal punishment to provoke

strong sentiments among parents. Some adamantly defend the

practice, while referring to the Bible: ÒSpare the rod, spoil the

child. ItÕs because parents donÕt spank that delinquency is now

rampant.Ó They are persuaded that spanking our children shows

that we love them by setting clear boundaries. Other parents are

The intention behind

force is only to protect,

not to punish, blame,

or condemn.
equally insistent that spanking is unloving and ineffective because
it teaches children that, when all else fails, we can always resort to

physical violence. 
My personal concern is that childrenÕs
fear of corporal punishment may obscure

their awareness of the compassion that

underlies parental demands. Parents often

tell me that they Òhave toÓ use punitive

force because they see no other way to

influence their children to do ÒwhatÕs good

for them.Ó They support their opinion with anecdotes of children

expressing appreciation for Òseeing the lightÓ after having been

punished. Having raised four children, I empathize deeply with

parents regarding the daily challenges they face in educating

children and keeping them safe. This does not, however, lessen my

concern about the use of physical punishment.
First, I wonder whether people who proclaim the successes of
such punishment are aware of the countless instances of children

who turn against what might be good for them simply because they

choose to fight, rather than succumb, to coercion. Second, the

apparent success of corporal punishment in influencing a child

doesnÕt mean that other methods of influence wouldnÕt have worked

equally well. Finally, I share the concerns of many parents about the

social consequences of using physical punishment. When parents

opt to use force, we may win the battle of getting children to do

what we want, but in the process, are we not perpetuating a social

norm that justifies violence as a means of resolving differences? 
In addition to the physical, other uses of force also qualify as
punishment. One is the use of blame to discredit another person: for

example, a parent may label a child as

Òwrong,Ó Òselfish,Ó or ÒimmatureÓ when a

child doesnÕt behave in a certain way.

Another form of punitive force is the

withholding of some means of gratification,

such as parentsÕ curtailing of allowance or

driving privileges. In this type of punishment, the withdrawal of
caring or respect is one of the most powerful threats of all. 
The Costs Of Punishment
When we submit to doing something solely for the purpose of

avoiding punishment, our attention is distracted from the value of

the action itself. Instead, we are focusing upon the consequences

of what might happen if we fail to take that action. If a workerÕs

performance is prompted by fear of punishment, the job gets done,
but morale suffers; sooner or later,

productivity will decrease. Self-esteem

is also diminished when punitive force

is used. If children brush their teeth

because they fear shame and ridicule,

their oral health may improve but their

self-respect will develop cavities.

Furthermore, as we all know, punishment

is costly in terms of goodwill. The more
we are seen as agents of punishment, the harder it is for others to

respond compassionately to our needs.
I was visiting a friend, a school principal, at his office when he
noticed through the window a big child hitting a smaller one.

ÒExcuse me,Ó he said as he leapt up and rushed to the playground.

Grabbing the larger child, he gave him a swat and scolded, ÒIÕll

teach you not to hit smaller people!Ó When the principal returned

inside, I remarked, ÒI donÕt think you taught that child what you

thought you were teaching him. I suspect what he learned instead

was not to hit people smaller than he is when somebody biggerÑ

like the principalÑmight be watching! If anything, it seems to me

that you have reinforced the notion that the way to get what you

want from somebody else is to hit them.Ó 
In such situations, I recommend first empathizing with the
child who is behaving violently. For example, if I saw a child

hit 
someone after being called a name, I might empathize, ÒIÕm
sensing that youÕre feeling angry because youÕd like to be treated

with more respect.Ó If I guessed correctly, and the child
acknowledges this to be true, I would then continue by expressing

my own feelings, needs, and requests in this situation without

insinuating blame: ÒIÕm feeling sad because I want us to find ways

to get respect that donÕt turn people into enemies. IÕd like you to

tell me if youÕd be willing to explore with me some other ways to

get the respect youÕre wanting.Ó 
Two Questions That Reveal 
The Limitations Of Punishment
Two questions help us see why we are unlikely to get what we want
by using punishment to change peopleÕs behavior. The first question

is: 
What do I want this person to do thatÕs different from what he or
she is currently doing?
If we ask only this first question, punishment
may seem effective because the threat or exercise of punitive force

may well influence the personÕs behavior. However, with the second

question, it becomes evident that punishment isnÕt likely to work:

What do I want this personÕs reasons to be for doing what IÕm asking?
We seldom address the latter question,
but when we do, we soon realize that

punishment and reward interfere with

peopleÕs ability to do things motivated

by the reasons weÕd like them to have. I

believe it is critical to be aware of the

importance of peopleÕs reasons for

behaving as we request. For example,

blaming or punishing would obviously not be effective strategies if we

want children to clean their rooms out of either a desire for order or a

desire to contribute to the parentsÕ enjoyment of order. Often children

clean their rooms motivated by obedience to authority (ÒBecause my

Mom said soÓ), avoidance of punishment, or fear of upsetting or

being rejected by parents. NVC, however, fosters a level of moral

development based on autonomy and interdependence, whereby we

acknowledge responsibility for our own actions and are aware that our

own well-being and that of others are one and the same.

Question 2: What do I

The Protective Use Of Force In Schools
IÕd like to describe how some students and I used protective force
to bring order into a chaotic situation at an alternative school. This

school was designed for students who had dropped out or been

expelled from conventional classrooms. The administration and I

hoped to demonstrate that a school based on the principles of NVC

would be able to reach these students. My job was to train the

faculty in NVC and serve as consultant over the year. With only

four days to prepare the faculty, I was unable to sufficiently clarify

the difference between NVC and permissiveness. As a result, some

teachers were ignoring, rather than intervening, in situations of

conflict and disturbing behavior. Besieged by increasing

pandemonium, the administrators were nearly ready to shut down

the school. 
When I requested to talk with the students who had contributed
most to the turbulence, the principal selected eight boys, ages

eleven to fourteen, to meet with me. The following are excerpts

from the dialogue I had with the students.
MBR:(Expressing my feeling and needs without asking probing
questions.) 
IÕm very upset about the teachersÕ reports
that things are getting out of hand in many of the

classes. I want very much for this school to be 
successful.
IÕm hopeful that you can help me understand what the

problems are and what can be done about them.

teachers and you want them to change some things

they do?

teachers when they stand around doing nothing. YouÕd

like them to do something. 
(This is a continued attempt
to fully understand.)
Will:

MBR:
I feel disappointed because I want them to be able to
work things out with students but it sounds like I wasnÕt

able to show them what I meant.
The discussion then turned to one particularly
pressing problem, that of students who didnÕt want to

work disturbing those who did.

IÕm anxious to try to solve this problem because the
teachers tell me itÕs the one that bothers them the most.

I would appreciate your sharing whatever ideas you

have with me.

(a stick covered with
leather that was carried by some principals in St. Louis

students when they bother others.

students will go willingly to the do-nothing room.

I said I thought the plan might work if we could show that the
purpose was not to punish, but to provide a place to go for those

who werenÕt ready to study, and simultaneously a chance to study

for those who wanted to study. I also suggested that a do-nothing

room would be more likely to succeed if it was known to be a

product of student brainstorming rather than staff decree. 
A do-nothing room was set up for students who were upset and
didnÕt feel like doing schoolwork or whose behavior kept others

from learning. Sometimes students asked to go; sometimes teachers

asked students to go. We placed the teacher who had best mastered

NVC in the do-nothing room, where she had some very productive

talks with the children who came in. This set-up was an immense

success in restoring order to the school because the students who

devised it made its purpose clear to their peers: to protect the rights

of students who wanted to learn. We used the dialogue with the

students to demonstrate to the teachers that there were other

means of resolving conflicts besides withdrawal from the conflict

or using punitive force. 
Summary
In situations where there is no opportunity for communication,

such as in instances of imminent danger, we may need to resort to

the protective use of force. The intention behind the protective use

of force is to prevent injury or injustice, never to punish or to

cause individuals to suffer, repent, or change. The punitive use of

force tends to generate hostility and to reinforce resistance to the

very behavior we are seeking. Punishment damages goodwill and

self-esteem, and shifts our attention from the intrinsic value of an

action to external consequences. Blaming and punishing fail to

contribute to the motivations we would like to inspire in others.

others. Passed down through generations, even centuries, much of

this destructive cultural learning is so ingrained in our lives that

we are no longer conscious of it. In one of his routines, comedian

Buddy Hackett, raised on his motherÕs rich cooking, claimed that

he never realized it was possible to leave the table without feeling

heartburn until he was in the army. In the same way, pain

engendered by damaging cultural conditioning is such an integral

part of our lives that we can no longer distinguish its presence. It

takes tremendous energy and awareness to recognize this

destructive learning and to transform it into thoughts and

behaviors that are of value and of service to life. 
This requires a literacy of needs and the ability to get in touch
with ourselves, both of which are difficult for people in our culture.

Not only have we never been educated to be literate about our

needs, we are often exposed to cultural training that actively

blocks our consciousness in this way. As mentioned earlier, we

have inherited a language that served kings and powerful elites in

domination societies. The masses, discouraged from developing

awareness of their own needs, have instead been educated to be
¥
171
¥
docile and subservient to authority. Our culture implies that needs
are negative and destructive; the word ÒneedyÓ applied to a person

suggests inadequacy or immaturity. When people express their

needs, they are often labeled ÒselfishÓ and the use of the personal

pronoun ÒIÓ is at times equated with selfishness or neediness.
By encouraging us to separate observation and evaluation, to
acknowledge the thoughts or needs shaping our feelings, and to

express our requests in clear action language, NVC heightens our
awareness of the cultural conditioning

influencing us at any given moment. And

drawing this conditioning into the light of

consciousness is a key step in breaking its

hold on us. 
Resolving Internal Conflicts
We can apply NVC to resolve the internal conflicts that often result

in depression. In his book, 
Revolution in Psychiatry
, Ernest Becker
attributes depression to Òcognitively arrested alternatives.Ó This

means that when we have a judgmental dialogue going on within,

we become alienated from what we are needing and cannot then

act to meet those needs. Depression is indicative of a state of

alienation from our own needs. 
A woman studying NVC was suffering a profound bout of
depression. She was asked to identify the voices within her when

she felt the most depressed and to write them down in dialogue

form as though they were speaking to each other. The first two

lines of her dialogue were:
Voice 1 (Òcareer womanÓ): I should do something more with my
life. IÕm wasting my education and talents.
Voice 2 (Òresponsible motherÓ): YouÕre being unrealistic. YouÕre
a mother of two children and canÕt handle 
that
responsibility, so
how can you handle anything else?Ó
Notice how these inner messages are infested with judgmental
terms and phrases such as Òshould,Ó Òwasting my education and

talents,Ó and ÒcanÕt handle.Ó Variations of this dialogue had been

running for months in the womanÕs head. She was then asked to
imagine the Òcareer womanÓ voice taking an ÒNVC pillÓ in order to

restate its message in the following form: ÒWhen

She subsequently translated ÒI should do something with my
life. IÕm wasting my education and talentsÓ into: Ò

I spend as
much time at home with the children as I do without practicing my

profession, 
I feel 
depressed and discouraged 
because I am needing
the fulfillment I once had in my profession. 
Therefore, I now would
like
to find part-time work in my profession.Ó
Then it was the turn of her Òresponsible motherÓ voice to
undergo the same process. The lines, ÒYouÕre being unrealistic.

YouÕre a mother of two children and canÕt handle 
that
responsibility,
so how can you handle anything else?Ó were transformed into:

Ò
When
I imagine going to work, 
I feel
scared 
because IÕm needing
reassurance that the children will be well taken care of. 
Therefore, I
now would like
to plan how to provide high-quality child care while
I work and how to find sufficient time to be with the children when

I am not tired.Ó
This woman felt great relief as soon as she translated her inner
messages into NVC. She was able to get beneath the alienating

messages she was repeating to herself and

offer herself empathy. Although she still

faced practical challenges such as securing

quality child care and her husbandÕs

support, she was no longer subject to the

judgmental internal dialogue that kept her

from being aware of her own needs. 
Caring For Our Inner Environment
When we are entangled in critical, blaming, or angry thoughts,

it is difficult to establish a healthy internal environment for

ourselves. NVC helps us create a more peaceful state of mind by

encouraging us to focus on what we are truly wanting rather than

on what is wrong with others or ourselves.

To be able to hear our

own feelings and needs

and to empathize with

them can free us from

depression. 
A participant once reported a profound personal breakthrough
during a three-day training. One of her goals for the workshop

was to take better care of herself, but she woke at dawn the second

morning with the worst headache in recent memory. ÒNormally,

the first thing IÕd do would be to analyze what I had done wrong.

Did I eat the wrong food? Did l let myself get stressed-out? Did I
do this; did I not do that? But, since I had

been working on using NVC to take better

care of myself, I asked instead, ÔWhat do I

need to do for myself right now with this

headache?Õ
ÒI sat up and did a lot of really slow neck rolls, then got up and
walked around, and did other things to take care of myself right

then instead of beating up on myself. My headache relaxed to the

point where I was able to go through the dayÕs workshop. This was

a major, major breakthrough for me. What I understood, when I

empathized with the headache, was that I hadnÕt given myself

enough attention the day before, and the headache was a way to

say to myself, ÔI need more attention.Õ I ended up giving myself the

attention I needed and was then able to make it through the

workshop. IÕve had headaches all my life, and this was a very

remarkable turning point for me.Ó
At another workshop a participant asked how NVC might be
used to free us from anger-provoking messages when we are

driving on the freeway. This was a familiar topic for me! For years

my work involved traveling by car across the country, and I was

worn and frazzled by the violence-provoking messages racing

through my brain. Everybody who wasnÕt driving by my standards

was an archenemy, a villain. Thoughts spewed through my head:

ÒWhat the hell is the matter with that guy!? DoesnÕt he even watch

where heÕs driving?Ó In this state of mind, all I wanted was to

punish the other driver, and since I couldnÕt do that, the anger

lodged in my body and exacted its toll. 
Eventually I learned to translate my judgments into feelings
and needs and to give myself empathy, ÒBoy, I am petrified when

people drive like that; I really wish they would
see the danger in what they are doing!Ó

Whew! I was amazed how less stressful a

situation I could create for myself by simply

becoming aware of what I was feeling and

needing rather than blaming others. 
Later I decided to practice empathy toward other drivers and
was rewarded with a gratifying first experience. I was stuck

behind a car going far below the speed limit that was slowing

down at every intersection. Fuming and grumbling, ÒThatÕs no

way to drive,Ó I noticed the stress I was causing myself and shifted

my thinking instead to what the driver might be feeling and

needing. I sensed that the person was lost,

feeling confused, and wishing for some

patience from those of us following. When the

road widened enough for me to pass, I saw that

the driver was a woman who looked to be in her

80Õs who wore an expression of terror on her face. I was pleased

that my attempt at empathy had kept me from honking the horn

or engaging in my customary tactics of displaying displeasure

toward people whose driving bothered me. 
Replacing Diagnosis With NVC
Many years ago, after having just invested nine years of my life

in the training and diplomas necessary to qualify as a

psychotherapist, I came across a dialogue between the Israeli

philosopher Martin Buber and the American psychologist Carl

Rogers, in which Buber questions whether anyone could do

psychotherapy in the role of a psychotherapist. Buber was visiting

the United States at the time, and had been invited, along with

Carl Rogers, to a discussion at a mental hospital in front of a

group of mental-health professionals. 
In this dialogue Buber posits that human growth occurs through
a meeting between two individuals who express themselves

vulnerably and authentically in what he termed an ÒI-ThouÓ

relationship. He did not believe that this type of authenticity was
likely to exist when people meet in the roles of psychotherapist and

client. Rogers agreed that authenticity was a prerequisite to growth.

He maintained, however, that enlightened psychotherapists could

choose to transcend their own role and encounter their clients

authentically.
Buber was skeptical. He was of the opinion that even if
psychotherapists were committed and able to relate to their clients

in an authentic fashion, such encounters would be impossible as

long as clients continued to view themselves as clients and their

psychotherapists as psychotherapists. He observed how the very

process of making appointments to see someone at their office, and

paying fees to be Òfixed,Ó dimmed the likelihood of an authentic

relationship developing between two persons. 
This dialogue clarified my own longstanding ambivalence
toward clinical detachmentÑa sacrosanct rule in the psychoanalytic

psychotherapy I was taught. To bring oneÕs own feelings and needs

into the psychotherapy was typically viewed as a sign of pathology

on the part of the therapist. Competent psychotherapists were to

stay out of the therapy process and to function as a mirror onto

which clients projected their transferences, which were then worked

through with the psychotherapistÕs help. I understood the theory

behind keeping the psychotherapistÕs inner process out of

psychotherapy and guarding against the danger of addressing

internal conflicts at the clientÕs expense. However, I had always

been uncomfortable maintaining the requisite emotional distance,

and furthermore believed in the advantages of bringing myself into

the process. 
I thus began to experiment by replacing clinical language with
the language of NVC. Instead of interpreting what my clients were

saying in line with personality theories I had studied, I made

myself present to their words and listened empathically. Instead of

diagnosing them, I revealed what was going on within myself. At

first, this was frightening. I worried about how colleagues would

react to the authenticity with which I was entering into dialogue
N

with clients. However, the results
were so gratifying to both the clients

and myself that I soon overcame any

hesitation. Today, 35 years later, the

concept of bringing oneself fully

into the client-therapist relationship

is no longer heretical, but when I began practicing this way, I was

often invited to speak by groups of psychotherapists who would

challenge me to demonstrate this new role. 
Once I was asked by a large gathering of mental health
professionals at a state mental hospital to show how NVC might

serve in counseling distressed people. After my one-hour

presentation, I was requested to interview a patient in order to

produce an evaluation and recommendation for treatment. I talked

with the 29-year-old mother of three children for about half an hour.

After she left the room, the staff responsible for her care posed their

questions. ÒDr. Rosenberg,Ó her psychiatrist began, Òplease make a

differential diagnosis. In your opinion, is this woman manifesting a

schizophrenic reaction or is this a case of drug-induced psychosis?Ó
I said that I was uncomfortable with such questions. Even when
I worked in a mental hospital during my training, I was never sure

how to fit people into the diagnostic classifications. Since then

I had read research indicating a lack of agreement among

psychiatrists and psychologists regarding these terms. The reports

concluded that diagnoses of patients in mental hospitals depended

more upon the school the psychiatrist had attended than the

characteristics of the patients themselves. 
I would be reluctant, I continued, to apply these terms even if
consistent usage did exist, because I failed to see how they

benefited patients. In physical medicine, pinpointing the disease

process that has created the illness often gives clear direction to

its treatment, but I did not perceive this relationship in the field

we call mental illness. In my experience, during case conferences

at hospitals, the staff would spend most of its time deliberating

over a diagnosis. As the allotted hour threatened to run out, the

I empathized with clients

them; I revealed myself

instead of diagnosing them.
psychiatrist in charge of the case might appeal to the others for
help in setting up a treatment plan. Often this request would be

ignored in favor of continued wrangling over the diagnosis. 
I explained to the psychiatrist that NVC urges me to ask myself
the following questions rather than think in terms of what is wrong

with a patient: ÒWhat is this person feeling? What is she or he

needing? How am I feeling in response to this person, and what

needs of mine are behind my feelings? What action or decision

would I request this person to take in the belief that it would enable

them to live more happily?Ó Because our responses to these

questions would reveal a lot about ourselves and our values, we

would feel far more vulnerable than if we were to simply diagnose

the other person.
On another occasion, I was called to demonstrate how NVC
could be taught to people diagnosed as chronic schizophrenics.

With about 80 psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and

nurses watching, 15 patients who had been thus diagnosed were

assembled on the stage for me. As I introduced myself and

explained the purpose of NVC, one of the patients expressed a

reaction that seemed irrelevant to what I was saying. Aware that

heÕd been diagnosed as a chronic schizophrenic, I succumbed to

clinical thinking by assuming that my failure to understand him

was due to his confusion. ÒYou seem to have trouble following

what IÕm saying,Ó I remarked.
At this, another patient interjected, ÒI understand what heÕs
saying,Ó and proceeded to explain the relevance of his words in the

context of my introduction. Recognizing that the man was not

confused, but that I had simply not grasped the connection

between our thoughts, I was dismayed by the ease with which I had

attributed responsibility for the breakdown in communication to

him. I would have liked to have owned my own feelings by saying,

for example, ÒIÕm confused. IÕd like to see the connection between

what I said and your response, but I donÕt. Would you be willing

to explain how your words relate to what I said?Ó 
With the exception of this brief departure into clinical thinking,
N

C

the session with the patients went successfully. The staff, impressed
with the patientsÕ responses, wondered whether I considered them

to be an unusually cooperative group of patients. I answered that

when I avoided diagnosing people and instead stayed connected

to the life going on in them and in myself, people usually

responded positively.
A staff member then requested a similar session to be conducted
as a learning experience with some of the psychologists and

psychiatrists as participants. At this, the patients who had been on

stage exchanged seats with several volunteers in the audience. In

working with the staff, I had a difficult time clarifying to one

psychiatrist the difference between intellectual understanding and the

empathy of NVC. Whenever someone in the group expressed feelings,

he would offer his understanding of the psychological dynamics

behind their feelings rather than empathize with the feelings. When

this happened for the third time, one of the patients in the audience

burst out, ÒCanÕt you see youÕre doing it again? YouÕre interpreting

what sheÕs saying rather than empathizing with her feelings!Ó
By adopting the skills and consciousness of NVC, we can
counsel others in encounters that are genuine, open, and mutual,

rather than resorting to professional relationships characterized by

emotional distancing, diagnosis, and hierarchy. 
Summary
NVC enhances inner communication by helping us translate negative

internal messages into feelings and needs. Our ability to distinguish

our own feelings and needs and to empathize with them can free us

from depression. We can replace Òdream-killing languageÓ with NVC

and recognize the existence of choice in all our actions. By showing

us how to focus on what we truly want rather than on what is wrong

with others or ourselves, NVC gives us the tools and understanding

to create a more peaceful state of mind. Professionals in counseling

and psychotherapy may also use NVC to engender relationships with

clients that are mutual and authentic.

NVC in Action
Dealing With Resentments And Self-Judgment
A student of Nonviolent Communication shares the
following story.
I had just returned from my first residential training in
NVC. A friend whom I hadnÕt seen for two years was

waiting for me at home. I first met Iris, who has been a

school librarian for 25 years, during an intense 2-week

heartwork and wilderness journey that had culminated in a

3-day solo fast in the Rockies. After she listened to my

enthusiastic description of NVC, Iris revealed that she was

still hurting from what one of the wilderness leaders in

Colorado had said to her six years ago. I had a clear

memory of that person: wild woman Leav, her palms

gouged with rope cuts holding steady a belayed body

dangling against the mountain face; she read animal

droppings, howled in the dark, danced her joy, cried her

truth and mooned our bus as we waved goodbye for the last

time. What Iris had heard Leav say during one of the

personal feedback sessions was this: ÒIris, I canÕt stand

people like you, always and everywhere being so damn nice

and sweet, constantly the meek little librarian that you are.

Why donÕt you just drop it and get on with it?Ó
For six years Iris had been listening to LeavÕs voice in
her head and for six years sheÕd been answering Leav in her

head. We were both eager to explore how a consciousness

of NVC would have affected this situation. I role-played

Leav and repeated her statement to Iris.
Iris:(forgetting about NVC, hears criticism and put-down)
You have no right to say that to me. You donÕt know

who I am, or what kind of librarian I am! I take 

my profession seriously, and for your information,

I consider myself to be an educator, just like any
teacher . . .
I:(with NVC consciousness, listening empathically, as
if I were Leav)
It sounds to me like youÕre angry
because you want me to know and recognize who

you really are before criticizing you. Is that so?
Iris:
ThatÕs right! You have simply no idea how much it
took for me to even sign up for this trek. Look! Here

I am: I finished, didnÕt I? I took on all the challenges

these fourteen days and overcame them all!
I as Leav:
Am I hearing that you feel hurt and would have
liked some recognition and appreciation for all your

courage and hard work?
A few more exchanges follow, whereupon Iris shows a
shift; these shifts can often be observed bodily when a

person feels ÒheardÓ to his or her satisfaction. For instance,

a person may relax and take a deeper breath at this moment.

This often indicates that the person has received adequate

empathy and is now able to shift attention to something

other than the pain they have been expressing. Sometimes

they are ready to hear another personÕs feelings and needs.

Or sometimes another round of empathy is needed to attend

to another area of pain in the person. In this situation with

Iris, I could see that another piece needed attention before

she would be able to hear Leav. This is because Iris had had

6 years of opportunity to put herself down for not having

produced an honorable comeback on the spot. After the

subtle shift, she immediately went on:
Iris:
Darn, I should have said all this stuff to her six
years ago!
I:(as myself, an empathic friend)
YouÕre frustrated
because you wish you could have articulated yourself

better at the time?

Iris:

I:
So you wish you had been enough in touch with
yourself to say that?
Iris:
Yes. And IÕm also mad at myself! I wish I hadnÕt let
her push me around. 
I:
YouÕd like to have been more assertive than you were? 
Iris:
Exactly, I need to remember I have a right to stand up
for who I am. 
Iris is quiet for a few seconds. She expresses readiness
to practice NVC and hear what Leav said to her in a

different way. 
I as Leav:
Iris, I canÕt stand people like you, always so nice
and sweet, being forever the meek little librarian.

Why donÕt you just drop it and get on with it?
Iris:(listening for LeavÕs feelings, needs and requests)
Oh,
Leav, it sounds to me like youÕre really frustrated . . .

frustrated because . . . because I . . . 
(Here Iris catches
herself at a common mistake. By using the word ÒI,Ó

she attributes LeavÕs feeling to Iris herself, rather

than to some desire on LeavÕs own part that generates

the feeling, i.e. not ÒYouÕre frustrated because I am a

certain way,Ó but ÒYouÕre frustrated because you

wanted something different from me.Ó) 
(She tries again)
Okay, Leav, it sounds like youÕre really
frustrated because you are wanting . . . um . . . youÕre

wanting. . . .
As I tried in my role-play to earnestly identify with
Leav, I felt a sudden flash of awareness of what I 
(as Leav)
was yearning for: ÒConnection! . . . ThatÕs what I am

wanting! I want to feel connected. . . . with you, Iris! And

I am so frustrated with all the sweetness and niceness that

We both sat a bit stunned after this outburst, and then
Iris said, ÒIf I had known thatÕs what she had wanted, if she

could have told me that it was genuine connection with me

she was after. . . . Gosh, I mean, that feels almost loving.Ó

While she never did find the real Leav to verify the insight,

after this practice session in NVC, Iris achieved an internal

resolution about this nagging conflict and found it easier to

hear with a new awareness when people around her said

things to her that she might previously have interpreted as

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Expressing Appreciation
In Nonviolent
Communication
The Intention Behind The Appreciation
ÒYou did a good job on that report.Ó
ÒYou are a very sensitive person.Ó

ÒIt was kind of you to offer me a ride home last evening.Ó
S
uch statements are typically uttered as expressions of

appreciation in life-alienating communication. Perhaps you
are surprised that I regard praise and compliments to be life-

alienating. Notice, however, that appreciation expressed in this

form reveals little of whatÕs going on in

the speaker and establishes the speaker as

someone who sits in judgment. I define

judgmentsÑboth positive and negativeÑas

life-alienating communication.
In the corporate trainings we offer, I often encounter managers
who defend the practice of praising and complimenting by

claiming that Òit works.Ó ÒResearch shows,Ó they assert, Òthat if a

manager compliments employees, they work harder. And the same

goes for schools: if teachers praise students, they study harder.Ó

Although I have reviewed this research, my belief is that recipients

of such praise do work harder, but only initially. Once they sense

the manipulation behind the appreciation, their productivity drops.
¥
185
¥
Compliments are often

judgmentsÑhowever

positiveÑof others. 
What is most disturbing for me, however, is that the beauty of
appreciation is spoiled when people begin to notice the lurking

intent to get something out of them. 
Furthermore, when we use positive feedback as a means to
influence others, it may not be clear how they are receiving the

message. There is a cartoon where one Native American remarks to

another, ÒWatch me use modern psychology on my horse!Ó He then

leads his friend near to where the horse can overhear their

conversation and exclaims, ÒI have the fastest, most courageous

horse in all the West!Ó The horse looks sad and says to itself, ÒHow

do you like that? HeÕs gone and bought himself another horse.Ó
When we use NVC to express appreci-
ation, it is purely to celebrate, not to get

something in return. Our sole intention is

to celebrate the way our lives have been

enriched by others. 
The Three Components Of Appreciation
NVC clearly distinguishes three components in the expression of

appreciation: 
1)the actions that have contributed to our well-being;

2)the particular needs of ours that have been fulfilled; and

3)the pleasureful feelings engendered by the fulfillment of
those needs.
The sequence of these ingredients may vary; sometimes all three
can be conveyed by a smile or a simple ÒThank you.Ó However, if
we want to ensure that our appreciation

has been fully received, it is valuable

to develop the eloquence to express

all three components verbally. The

following dialogue illustrates how praise

may be transformed into an appreciation

that embraces all three components.

Why, what do you mean?

In my lifetime IÕve been called a multitude of names,

Participant:

MBR:

MBR: 
Ah, so itÕs my saying those two things that you
appreciate.
Participant:
Yes.
MBR: 
Next, IÕd like to know how you feel in conjunction to
my having said those two things.

searching for some direction that might help me to

relate with him in a more loving manner, and those

two things you said provide the direction I was

looking for.

Hearing all three pieces of informationÑwhat I did, how she felt,
and what needs of hers were fulfilledÑI could then celebrate the

appreciation with her. Had she initially expressed her appreciation in

NVC, it might have sounded like this: ÒMarshall, when you said these

two things [showing me her notes], I felt very hopeful and relieved,

because IÕve been searching for a way to make a connection with my

son, and these gave me the direction I was looking for.Ó
Receiving Appreciation
Many of us do not receive appreciation gracefully. We fret over

whether we deserve it. We worry about whatÕs being expected of usÑ

especially if we have teachers or managers who use appreciation as

a means to spur productivity. Or weÕre nervous about living up to the

appreciation. Accustomed to a culture where buying, earning, and

deserving are the standard modes of interchange, we are often

uncomfortable with simple giving and receiving.
NVC encourages us to receive appreciation with the same
quality of empathy we express when listening to other messages.

We hear what we have done that has contributed to othersÕ well-

being; we hear their feelings and the needs that were fulfilled. We

take into our hearts the joyous reality that we can each enhance

the quality of othersÕ lives.
I was taught to receive appreciation with grace by my friend,
Nafez Assailey. He was a member of a Palestinian team whom I had

invited to Switzerland for training in NVC at a time when security

precautions made training of mixed groups of Palestinians and

Israelis impossible in either of their own countries. At the end of

the workshop, Nafez came up to me. ÒThis training will be very

valuable for us in working for peace in our country,Ó he

acknowledged. ÒI would like to thank you in a way that we Sufi

Muslims do when we want to express special appreciation for

something.Ó Locking his thumb onto mine, he looked me in the eye

and said, ÒI kiss the God in you that allows you to give us what

you did.Ó He then kissed my hand.

NafezÕs expression of gratitude
showed me a different way to receive

appreciation. Usually it is received from

one of two polar positions. At one end

is egotism: believing ourselves to be

superior because weÕve been appreciated. At the other extreme is

false humility, denying the importance of the appreciation by

shrugging it off: ÒOh, it was nothing.Ó Nafez showed me that I

could receive appreciation joyfully, in the awareness that God has

given everyone the power to enrich the lives of others. If I am

aware that it is this power of God working through me that gives

me the power to enrich life for others, then I may avoid both the

ego trap and the false humility. 
Golda Meir, when she was the Israeli prime minister, once
chided one of her ministers: ÒDonÕt be so humble, youÕre not that

great.Ó The following lines, attributed to contemporary writer

Marianne Williamson, serve as another reminder for me to avoid

the pitfall of false humility: 
O
ur deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.

Our 
deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond
measure.
It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us.
You are a child of God. Your playing small doesnÕt

serve the world.
ThereÕs nothing enlightened about shrinking so
that other people wonÕt feel insecure around you.
We were born to make manifest the glory of God
that is within us. ItÕs not just in some of us, it is in

everyone.
And as we let our own light shine, we uncon-
sciously give other people permission to do the same.
As we are liberated from our fear, our presence
automatically liberates others.

The Hunger For Appreciation
Paradoxically, despite our unease in receiving appreciation, most of
us yearn to be genuinely recognized and appreciated. During a

surprise party for me, a 12-year-old friend of mine suggested a

party game to help introduce the guests to each other. We were to

write down a question, drop it in a box, and then take turns, each

person drawing out a question and responding to it out loud.
Having recently consulted with various social service agencies
and industrial organizations, I was feeling struck by how often

people expressed a hunger for appreciation on the job. ÒNo matter

how hard you work,Ó they would sigh, Òyou never hear a good

word from anyone. But make one mistake and thereÕs always

someone jumping all over you.Ó So for the game, I wrote the

question, ÒWhat appreciation might someone give you that would

leave you jumping for joy?Ó
A woman drew that question out of the box, read it, and started
to cry. As director of a shelter for battered women, she would put

considerable energy each month into creating a schedule to please as

many people as possible. Yet each time the schedule was presented,

at least a couple of individuals would complain. She couldnÕt

remember ever receiving appreciation for her efforts to design a fair

schedule. All this had flashed through her mind as she read my

question, and the hunger for appreciation brought tears to her eyes.
Upon hearing the womanÕs story, another friend of mine said
that he, too, would like to answer the question. Everyone else then

requested a turn; as they responded to the question, several people

wept.
While the craving for appreciationÑas opposed to manipulative
ÒstrokesÓÑis particularly evident in the workplace, it affects family

life as well. One evening when I pointed out his failure to perform
a house chore, my son Brett retorted, ÒDad, are

you aware how often you bring up whatÕs

gone wrong but almost never bring up whatÕs

gone right?Ó His observation stayed with me.

I realized how I was continually searching for

improvements, while barely stopping to celebrate things that were
going well. I had just completed a workshop with over a hundred

participants, all of whom had evaluated it very highly, with the

exception of one person. However, what lingered in my mind was

that one personÕs dissatisfaction. 
That evening I wrote a song that began,
ÒIf IÕm ninety eight percent perfect 

in anything I do,

itÕs the two percent IÕve messed up

IÕll remember when IÕm through.Ó
It occurred to me that I had a choice to adopt instead the
outlook of a teacher I knew. One of her students, having neglected

to study for an exam, had resigned himself to turning in a blank

piece of paper with his name at the top.. He was surprised when

she later returned the test to him with a grade of 14%. ÒWhat did

I get 14% for?Ó he asked incredulously. ÒNeatness,Ó she replied.

Ever since my son BrettÕs Òwake-up call,Ó IÕve tried to be more

aware of what others around me are doing that enriches my life

and to hone my skills in expressing this appreciation.
Overcoming The Reluctance To 
Express Appreciation
I was deeply touched by a passage in John PowellÕs book, 
The
Secret of Staying in Love
, in which he describes his sadness over
having been unable, during his fatherÕs lifetime, to express the

appreciation he felt for him. How grievous it seemed to me to miss

the chance of appreciating the people who have been the greatest

positive influences in our lives!
Immediately an uncle of mine, Julius Fox, came to mind. When
I was a boy, he came daily to offer nursing care to my grandmother,

who was totally paralyzed. While he cared for my grandmother,

he always had a warm and loving smile on his face. No matter

how unpleasant the task may have appeared to my boyish eyes,

he treated her as if she were doing him the greatest favor in the

¥
world by 
letting him care for her. This provided a wonderful model
of masculine strength for meÑone that IÕve often called upon in the

years since.
I realized that I had never expressed my appreciation for my
uncle, who himself was now ill and near death. I considered doing so,

but sensed my own resistance: ÒIÕm sure he already knows how much

he means to me, I donÕt need to express it out loud; besides, it might

embarrass him if I put it into words.Ó As soon as these thoughts

entered my head, I already knew they werenÕt true. Too often I had

assumed that others knew the intensity of my appreciation for them,

only to discover otherwise. And even when people were embarrassed,

they still wanted to hear appreciation verbalized. 
Still hesitant, I told myself that words couldnÕt do justice to the
depths of what I wished to communicate. I quickly saw through

that one, though: yes, words may be poor vehicles in conveying

our heartfelt realities, but as I have learned, ÒAnything that is

worth doing is worth doing poorly!Ó 
As it happened, I soon found myself seated next to Uncle Julius
at a family gathering and the words simply flowed out of me. He

took them in joyfully, without embarrassment. Brimming over with

feelings from the evening, I went home, composed a poem and sent

it to him. I was later told that, each day until he died three weeks

later, my uncle had asked that the poem be read to him. 
Summary
Conventional compliments often take the form of judgments,

however positive, and are sometimes offered to manipulate the

behavior of others. NVC encourages the expression of appreciation

solely for celebration. We state (1) the action that has contributed

to our well-being, (2) the particular need of ours that has been

fulfilled, and (3) the feeling of pleasure engendered as a result. 
When we receive appreciation expressed in this way, we can do
so without any feeling of superiority or false humility by celebrating

along with the person who is offering the appreciation.

Epilogue
I
once asked my uncle Julius how he had developed such a
remarkable capacity to give compassionately. He seemed
honored by my question, which he pondered before replying, ÒIÕve

been blessed with good teachers.Ó When I asked who these were,

he recalled, ÒYour grandmother was the best teacher I had. You

lived with her when she was already ill, so you didnÕt know what

she was really like. For example, did your mother ever tell you

about the time during the Depression when she brought a tailor

and his wife and two children to live with her for three years, after

he lost his house and business?Ó I remembered the story well. It had

left a deep impression when my mother first told it to me because

I could never figure out where Grandmother had found space for

the tailorÕs family when she was raising nine children of her own

in a modest-sized house! 
Uncle Julius recollected my grandmotherÕs compassion in a few
more anecdotes, all of which I had heard as a child. Then he asked,

Ò
Surely your mother told you about Jesus.
Ó
ÒAbout who?Ó

ÒJesus.Ó

ÒNo, she never told me about Jesus.Ó

The story about Jesus was the final precious gift I received
from my uncle before he died. ItÕs a true story of a time when a

man came to my grandmotherÕs back door asking for some food.

This wasnÕt unusual. Although Grandmother was very poor, the

entire neighborhood knew that she would feed anyone who

showed up at her door. The man had a beard and wild scraggly

black hair; his clothes were ragged and he wore a cross around his

neck fashioned out of branches tied with rope. My grandmother

invited him into her kitchen for some food, and while he was

eating she asked his name.
ÒMy name is Jesus,Ó he replied.

ÒDo you have a last name?Ó she inquired.
¥
193
¥
ÒI am Jesus the Lord.Ó (My grandmotherÕs English wasnÕt too
good. Another uncle, Isidor, later told me he had come into the

kitchen while the man was still eating and Grandmother had

introduced the stranger as ÒMr. Thelord.Ó)
As he continued to eat, my grandmother asked where he lived.

ÒI donÕt have a home.Ó

ÒWell, where are you going to stay tonight? ItÕs cold.Ó

ÒI donÕt know.Ó

ÒWould you like to stay here?Ó she offered.

He stayed seven years.

When it came to communicating nonviolently, my grandmother
was a natural. She didnÕt think of what this man Òwas.Ó If she did,

she probably would have judged him as crazy and gotten rid of

him. No, she thought in terms of what people feel and what they

need. If theyÕre hungry, feed them. If theyÕre without a roof over

their head, give them a place to sleep. 
My grandmother loved to dance, and my mother remembers
her saying often, ÒNever walk when you can dance.Ó And thus I

end this book on a language of compassion with a song about my

grandmother, who spoke and lived the language of Nonviolent

Communication. 
One day a man named Jesus
came around to my grandmotherÕs door.

He asked for a little food,

she gave him more.
He said he was Jesus the Lord;
she didnÕt check him out with Rome.

He stayed for several years,

as did many without a home.
It was in her Jewish way,
she taught me what Jesus had to say.

In that precious way,

she taught me what Jesus had to say.

About NVC
From the bedroom to the boardroom, from the classroom to the war zone,
Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is changing lives every day. NVC provides an

easy to grasp, effective method to get to the root of violence and pain peacefully.
By examining the unmet needs behind what we do or say, NVC helps reduce
hostility, heal pain, and strengthen professional and personal relationships.
NVC helps us reach beneath the surface and discover what is alive and vital
within us, and how all of our actions are based on human needs that we are
seeking to meet. We learn to develop a vocabulary of feelings and needs that
helps us more clearly express what is going on in us at any given moment.

When we understand and acknowledge our needs, we develop a shared

foundation for much more satisfying relationships. Join the thousands of people

worldwide who have improved their relationships and their lives with this simple

yet revolutionary process.

About the Author
Marshall B. Rosenberg, Ph.D.
is the founder
and director of educational services for the Center
for Nonviolent Communication, an international

peacemaking organization. He is the author of

Speak Peace in a World of Conflict
, and the
bestselling 
Nonviolent Communication: A Language
of Life
. Dr. Rosenberg is the 2006 recipient of
the 
Global Village Foundation's Bridge of Peace
Award, and the Association of Unity Churches
International 2006 Light of God Expressing Award. Rosenberg spends
more than 250 days each year traveling the globe, teaching Nonviolent

Communication (NVC) in hundreds of local communities, at national

conferences, and in some of the most impoverished, war-torn states of

the world.
Growing up in a turbulent Detroit neighborhood, Dr. Rosenberg
developed a keen interest in new forms of communication that would
provide peaceful alternatives to the violence he encountered. His

interest led to a doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of

Wisconsin in 1961, where he studied under Carl Rogers. His subsequent

life experience and study of comparative religion motivated him to

develop the Nonviolent Communication (NVC) process.
Dr. Rosenberg first used the NVC process in federally funded school
integration projects to provide mediation and communication skills

training during the 1960s. He founded the Center for Nonviolent

Communication in 1984, an international nonprofit peacemaking

organization, which is now affiliated with more than 180 certified NVC

trainers in 35 countries around the globe. 
With guitar and puppets in hand, a history of traveling to some of
the most violent corners of the world, and a spiritual energy that fills a

room, Rosenberg shows us how to create a much more peaceful and

satisfying world. Dr. Rosenberg is currently based in Wasserfallenhof,

Switzerland.
